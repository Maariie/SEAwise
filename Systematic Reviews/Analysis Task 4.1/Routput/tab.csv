SW4_0728;E4;Simons S.L., Döring R., Temming A.;Modelling fishers' response to discard prevention strategies: The case of the North Sea saithe fishery;2015;ICES Journal of Marine Science;72;5;1530;1544;10.1093/icesjms/fsu229;;Designing effective management plans requires understanding fishers' behaviour under that plan, because fishers change their behaviour in response to economic and management incentives, which in turn will lead to different fishery outcomes. This study presents a modelling framework for management strategy evaluations which takes into account the response of fishers to management schemes. Based on the upcoming discard ban, two discard prevention strategies were tested for the North Sea saithe fishery, where fleet segments have either no or a generally low quota for cod. Costs and benefits were assessed under the current management, a non-flexible system, where fleet segments had to stop fishing once the cod quota was reached and a flexible system where quota of saithe could be used to cover over-quota catch of cod at a ratio 1:5. The flexible scenario was beneficial both in protecting the North Sea saithe and cod stock and in increasing net profits of fleet segments in the long term. The avoidance behaviour of fleet segments to over-quota catch led to a high SSB level of saithe and cod in the long term, ensuring high long-term catches and profits. A non-flexible scenario had a negative impact on the saithe stock, because mainly juvenile saithe before spawning were caught reducing the spawning-stock biomass in the longer term. A non-flexible scenario was costly in terms of up to 29% lower net profits for individual fleet segments generating little economic incentive to be compliant. © 2014 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2014.

Harvest selection may also act on behavioral traits, although this field of research has so far received less attention. We used acoustic tags and a network of receivers to monitor the behavior and fate of individual Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua, N = 60) in their natural habitat on the Norwegian Skagerrak coast. Fish with a strong diel vertical migration, alternating between shallow- and deep-water habitats, had a higher risk of being captured in the fishery (traps, gillnet, hand line) as compared to fish that stayed in deeper water. There was also a significant negative correlation between fish size (30-66 cm) and the magnitude of diel vertical migration.Natural selection on behavior was less clear, but tended to favor fish with a large activity space. On a monthly time scale we found significant repeatabilities for cod behavior, meaning that individual characteristics tended to persist and thereforemay be termed personality traits.We argue that an evolutionary approach to fisheries management should consider fish behavior. This would be of particular relevance for spatial management actions such as marine reserve design. © 2012 The Authors.

We focused on the flatfish fishery in the North Sea and explored how spawning closures for plaice and sole contribute to sustainable management of 4 target species (sole, plaice, turbot and brill). Seasonal patterns in fishing effort and catchability by age group and area were estimated to quantify the effect of different spawning closure scenarios on the selection pattern. The scenario performance was evaluated using indicators of stock status (spawning stock biomass), economic performance of the fishery (yield, revenue) and ecosystem impact (discards, bycatch of cod and rays, seabed integrity, fisheries-induced evolution). In a single-species context, spawning closures may be beneficial for the target species, while in a mixed fisheries and ecosystem context, negative effects may occur. A spawning closure for plaice combines positive effects on the plaice stock and the revenue with reductions of the negative impact for several ecosystem indicators and only a small negative effect on sea bed integrity. The effects did not differ when evaluated at current levels of effort or at maximum sustainable yield (MSY) effort. Tailor-made solutions are required that need to be developed in stakeholder consultation to trade-off the ecological and economic objectives.

Fish numbers and sizes were surveyed by visual census at Scandola (Corsica) in and outside reserve zones subject to increasing levels of protection, including unprotected zones (UP) where all fishing activities are permitted, buffer zones (BZ) subject to partial protection and a totally protected no-take integral reserve zone (IR). The numerical abundance, individual size and biomass of the brown meagre were found to increase with levels of reserve protection. The abundance of the larger size classes and the numbers of fish per shoal were significantly lower in unprotected zones.

This study is based on direct observation of the seafloor by means of Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) dives and reports litter abundance, type and distribution in three large submarine canyons of the NW Mediterranean Sea, namely Cap de Creus, La Fonera and Blanes canyons. Our ultimate objective is establishing the links between active hydrodynamic processes and litter distribution, thus going beyond previous, essentially descriptive studies.Litter was monitored using the Liropus 2000 ROV. Litter items were identified in 24 of the 26 dives carried out in the study area, at depths ranging from 140 to 1731. m. Relative abundance of litter objects by type, size and apparent weight, and distribution of litter in relation to depth and canyon environments (i.e. floor and flanks) were analysed. Plastics are the dominant litter component (72%), followed by lost fishing gear, disregarding their composition (17%), and metal objects (8%). Most of the observed litter seems to be land-sourced. It reaches the ocean through wind transport, river discharge and after direct dumping along the coastline. While coastal towns and industrial areas represent a permanent source of litter, tourism and associated activities relevantly increase litter production during summer months ready to be transported to the deep sea by extreme events. After being lost, fishing gear such as nets and long-lines has the potential of being harmful for marine life (e.g. by ghost fishing), at least for some time, but also provides shelter and a substrate on which some species like cold-water corals are capable to settle and grow.La Fonera and Cap de Creus canyons show the highest mean concentrations of litter ever seen on the deep-sea floor, with 15,057 and 8090itemskm-2, respectively, and for a single dive litter observed reached 167,540itemskm-2. While most of the largest concentrations were found on the canyon floors at water depths exceeding 1000m, relatively little litter was identified on the canyon walls. The finding of litter 'hotspots' (i.e., large accumulations of litter) formed by mixtures of land- and marine-sourced litter items and natural debris such as sea urchin carcasses evidences an efficient transport to the floor of mid and lower canyon reaches at least.High-energy, down canyon near-bottom flows are known to occur in the investigated canyons. These are associated to seasonal dense shelf water cascading and severe coastal storms, which are the most energetic hydrodynamic processes in the study area thus becoming the best candidates as main carriers of debris to the deep.

During the summer of 2006 and 2008, land-based surveys were carried out at Lampedusa, one of the Archipelago's Islands, at set hours from 6 locations (7 in 2008) in standard weather conditions. Continuous horizon scanning and focal group sampling methods were used to study dolphin presence and behaviour. Dolphin-boat interactions were recorded for each sighting. A total of approximately 559 hours were spent monitoring and 83 sightings were recorded. With regard to the different types of vessels, interaction with sailing boats was always neutral, whereas fast boats caused the interruption of all activities and avoidance behaviour. Positive interaction occasionally occurred with bottom trawling fishing boats. Interactions recorded when fishing and powered engine boats approached within 200 m predominantly resulted in a negative reaction from the dolphins (approximately 70%) and dolphin behaviour was affected in terms of occurrence and patterns. Behavioural analysis showed that the animals reduced the frequency of behaviours related to feeding, social and relaxing activities. The dolphins also increased information-gathering behaviour such as spyhopping. The use of Markovian chain models revealed evidence of disruptions in sub-sequences made up of behaviours often associated with feeding. After boat departures, the animals rarely restarted their previous activity and persistence of this effect could have long-term consequences as a result of non-habituation. Sighting duration also decreased in the presence of vessels. The possible negative long-term effect of the presence of boats may be indicated by the lower mean sighting duration in 2008, when the highest presence of powered engine boats was recorded. In view of the scenario outlined above, local authorities need to enforce the requirement of maintaining a distance of over 200 m away from the animals for all types of boat and also promote regular land-based surveys of vessel impacts for tourist boats and dolphin watching cruises. © 2012 Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;Mediterranean - non CS;1,000-5,000;two year;100-500;year;Visual Analyses of Quadrats/Transects;NA;Markovian chain models;3;2;3;NA;NA;4.4;Field experiment;Marine_mammals;Cetaceans;Toothed_cetacean;NA;Tursiops truncatus;Catch_and_bycatch;Bycatch;vessel distance and boat type;NA;Recreational;NA;NA;sailing boats;Normal swim _ Fast swim _ Long dive _ Short dive _ Surface finning/sharking _ Breach _ Leap _ Tail slap _ Chin up _ Vertical leap _ Flipper slap _ Lateral breach _ Surface accelerate _ Spy hop _ Chin slap _ Cartwheeling _ Change direction _ Non-quantified dive _ Catching _ Milling _ Departing swim _ Resting _ End sighting;Behaviour;No impact;Interaction with sailing boats was always neutral.;Altuna-Etxabe

We studied the ecosystem effects of the deep-sea red shrimp Aristaeomorpha foliacea trawl fishery (500 to 800 m) in the Strait of Sicily, at the population and community level by sampling in trawled and non-trawled sites as determined by vessel monitoring system (VMS) fishing effort data. The study was conducted within the Maltese 25 nautical mile Fisheries Management Zone as part of the ongoing MEDITS trawl survey. Samples were collected using an experimental otter trawl net with a cod-end stretched mesh size of 20 mm, from 7 stations located in trawled sites (mean depth 616 ± 26 m) and from 7 stations in non-trawled sites (mean depth 556 ± 40 m). Population and community indicators were compared across the trawled and non-trawled sites. Populations of A. foliacea and Etmopterus spinax did not show any differences in biomass between the trawled and non-trawled sites, whereas the biomass of Plesionika martia, Nephrops norvegicus, Helicolenus dactylopterus dactylopterus and Galeus melastomus was 4 times, 16 times, 6 times and 2 times higher, respectively, at the non-trawled sites. Changes in length structure were also detected for all species except for E. spinax. At the community level, higher biomass, density and diversity indices were recorded at the non-trawled sites. Despite the clear evidence of ecosystem changes due to fishing, the main target species, A. foliacea and P. martia, had a high resilience to trawling activities.

The area closed was named the 'Plaice Box' (PB) and beam trawl effort fell by over 90%,while the exemption fleets of small flatfish beam trawlers, gill netters targeting sole (. Solea solea) and shrimp (. Crangon crangon) trawlers increased their effort. Contrary to the expectation, plaice landings and biomass declined. The initial support for the PB from the fisheries was lost, whereas other stakeholder groups claimed that any failure was due to the fact that fishing had never been completely prohibited in the area. To evaluate whether the PB has been an effective management measure, the changes in the ecosystem (plaice, demersal fish, benthos) and fisheries are analyzed to test whether the observed changes are due to the PB or to changes in the environment unrelated to the PB. Juvenile growth rate of plaice decreased and juveniles moved to deeper waters outside the PB. Demersal fish biomass decreased, whereas the abundance of epibenthic predators (. Asterias rubens and Cancer pagurus) increased in the PB. Endobenthos, in particular the main food items of plaice (polychaetes and small bivalves) remained stable or decreased both inside and outside the PB. Currently catches of both plaice and sole from within the PB are lower than in the late 1980s and the exemption fleet often prefers to fish outside the Plaice Box alongside much larger competitors. It is concluded that the observed changes are most likely related to changes in the North Sea ecosystem, which may be related to changes in eutrophication and temperature.

The area closed was named the 'Plaice Box' (PB) and beam trawl effort fell by over 90%,while the exemption fleets of small flatfish beam trawlers, gill netters targeting sole (. Solea solea) and shrimp (. Crangon crangon) trawlers increased their effort. Contrary to the expectation, plaice landings and biomass declined. The initial support for the PB from the fisheries was lost, whereas other stakeholder groups claimed that any failure was due to the fact that fishing had never been completely prohibited in the area. To evaluate whether the PB has been an effective management measure, the changes in the ecosystem (plaice, demersal fish, benthos) and fisheries are analyzed to test whether the observed changes are due to the PB or to changes in the environment unrelated to the PB. Juvenile growth rate of plaice decreased and juveniles moved to deeper waters outside the PB. Demersal fish biomass decreased, whereas the abundance of epibenthic predators (. Asterias rubens and Cancer pagurus) increased in the PB. Endobenthos, in particular the main food items of plaice (polychaetes and small bivalves) remained stable or decreased both inside and outside the PB. Currently catches of both plaice and sole from within the PB are lower than in the late 1980s and the exemption fleet often prefers to fish outside the Plaice Box alongside much larger competitors. It is concluded that the observed changes are most likely related to changes in the North Sea ecosystem, which may be related to changes in eutrophication and temperature. It is less likely that they are related to the change in fishing.

Bird carcasses were collected and information on fishing effort obtained from fishermen using interviews and on-board observations on selected trips. Bycatch of seabirds occurred with all types of fishing gear and métiers studied, with highest bycatch rates in coastal lagoons. The minimum estimate of total bycatch in nets set by 440 commercial fishermen was found to be 17 551 (range 14 905-20 533) birds annually between November and May. Bycatch in set nets and on longlines in summer was much lower. Bycatch rates were found to depend either directly on bird abundance as shown for the long-tailed duck (Clangula hyemalis) or on predictors of abundance such as water depth and location. Bycatch in the Pomeranian Bay has decreased over 20years due to the severe decline of seaducks, particularly of long-tailed ducks, which were most frequently bycaught. The estimated individual bycatch risk has also decreased in long-tailed ducks but the current monthly losses of 0.81% may still indicate a potential threat for this species. Bycatch monitoring based on carcass collections and interviews proved to be feasible over a 20-year period although the results contain some underreporting. Based on the results specific measures are recommended to reduce bycatch risk in the German coastal fisheries using targeted effort reductions and replacement of set nets with alternative gear. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;CS - Baltic Sea;>100,000;two year;10,000-50,000;day;Behavioural Observations;NA;Generalized linear mixed effects models _ zero inflated Poisson model;3;3;3;NA;NA;4.2;Fisheries dependent survey;Seabirds;NA;NA;NA;Diving ducks _ Seaducks _ Mergansers _ Grebes _ Divers _ Phalacrocorax carbo _ Fulica atra _ Auks _ Larus spp.;Catch_and_bycatch;Bycatch;Effort;water depth _ location _ season;Commercial;Nets;Gillnet;Clupea harengus _ Belone belone;Number of birds;Abundance/biomass/density;Negative;The minimum estimate of total bycatch in nets set by 440 commercial fishermen was found to be 17551 (range 14 905–20 533) birds annually between November and May.

Bird carcasses were collected and information on fishing effort obtained from fishermen using interviews and on-board observations on selected trips. Bycatch of seabirds occurred with all types of fishing gear and métiers studied, with highest bycatch rates in coastal lagoons. The minimum estimate of total bycatch in nets set by 440 commercial fishermen was found to be 17 551 (range 14 905-20 533) birds annually between November and May. Bycatch in set nets and on longlines in summer was much lower. Bycatch rates were found to depend either directly on bird abundance as shown for the long-tailed duck (Clangula hyemalis) or on predictors of abundance such as water depth and location. Bycatch in the Pomeranian Bay has decreased over 20years due to the severe decline of seaducks, particularly of long-tailed ducks, which were most frequently bycaught. The estimated individual bycatch risk has also decreased in long-tailed ducks but the current monthly losses of 0.81% may still indicate a potential threat for this species. Bycatch monitoring based on carcass collections and interviews proved to be feasible over a 20-year period although the results contain some underreporting.

In addition to this commercial pressure, the impact of recreational activities on fish assemblages remains barely known. Here we examined the impact of spearfishing limitation on resources in a marine protected area (MPA) and the benefit it provides for the local artisanal fishery through the use of a novel indicator. We analysed trends in the fish assemblage composition using artisanal fisheries data collected in the Bonifacio Strait Natural Reserve (BSNR), a Mediterranean MPA where the spearfishing activity has been forbidden over 15% of its area. Fish species were pooled into three response groups according to their target level by spearfishing. We developed the new flexible ReGS indicator reflecting shifts in species assemblages according to the relative abundance of each response group facing external pressure. The catch per unit effort (CPUE) increased by ca. 60% in the BSNR between 2000 and 2007, while the MPA was established in 1999. The gain of CPUE strongly depended on the considered response group: for the highly targeted group, the CPUE doubled while the CPUE of the untargeted group increased by only 15.5%. The ReGS value significantly increased from 0.31 to 0.45 (on a scale between 0 and 1) in the general perimeter of this MPA while it has reached a threshold of 0.43, considered as a reference point, in the area protected from spearfishing since 1982. Our results demonstrated that limiting recreational fishing by appropriate zoning in multiple-use MPAs represents a real benefit for artisanal fisheries.

Current knowledge on the response of benthic communities to the impact of trawling is still rudimentary. In the present study, we used data collected in the Barents Sea during 2011 to assess the vulnerability of benthic species to trawling, based on the risk of being caught or damaged by a bottom trawl. Using trait table analysis, we identified 23 ""high-risk"" benthic species, which include ""large weight and upraised"" taxa as ""easily caught"" by a bottom trawl. We further identified a ""low-risk"" category containing 245 taxa/species and a ""medium-risk"" category with 80 species. A clear decline in biomass was noted for all three categories when comparing trawled vs. untrawled areas. This suggests that trawling significantly affects the biomass of all species, but predominantly the ""high-risk"" taxa. Some Barents Sea regions were particularly susceptible to trawling due to the dominance of the ""high-risk"" species, including Geodia sponges in the southwestern Barents Sea, basket stars (Gorgonocephalus) in the northern Barents Sea, sea pen (Umbellula encrinus) on the shelf facing the Arctic Ocean, and sea cucumber (Cucumaria frondosa) in shallow southern areas.

Current knowledge on the response of benthic communities to the impact of trawling is still rudimentary. In the present study, we used data collected in the Barents Sea during 2011 to assess the vulnerability of benthic species to trawling, based on the risk of being caught or damaged by a bottom trawl. Using trait table analysis, we identified 23 ""high-risk"" benthic species, which include ""large weight and upraised"" taxa as ""easily caught"" by a bottom trawl. We further identified a ""low-risk"" category containing 245 taxa/species and a ""medium-risk"" category with 80 species. A clear decline in biomass was noted for all three categories when comparing trawled vs. untrawled areas. This suggests that trawling significantly affects the biomass of all species, but predominantly the ""high-risk"" taxa. Some Barents Sea regions were particularly susceptible to trawling due to the dominance of the ""high-risk"" species, including Geodia sponges in the southwestern Barents Sea, basket stars (Gorgonocephalus) in the northern Barents Sea, sea pen (Umbellula encrinus) on the shelf facing the Arctic Ocean, and sea cucumber (Cucumaria frondosa) in shallow southern areas. These findings can guide management decisions to meet targets set by the United Nations Convention of Biological Diversity and the OSPAR Commission (""Protecting and Conserving the North-East Atlantic and its Resources"").

However, our knowledge of which species have changed in abundance and body size distributions, and the reasons for these changes, is limited due to a paucity of historical data. Here we report a study of long-term change in a marine fish assemblage from the inshore waters of the Western English Channel, near Plymouth. We compiled data from historic trawls undertaken between 1913 and 1922, and resurveyed those sites in 2008 and 2009. Our results revealed highly significant temporal differences in assemblage composition, but the scale of change was not consistent among taxonomic groups. Dramatic changes were recorded within the elasmobranchs, characterised by a reduction in abundance of all skate (Rajiidae) species, apparent extirpation of the angel shark (Squatina squatina), and large increases in the abundance of lesser-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula). By contrast we observed less evidence of change among 'flatfishes' (Pleuronectiformes) or 'roundfishes' (other teleosts). Changes were also observed in length-frequency distributions, with a significant decline in the size distribution of elasmobranchs (excluding S. canicula), but no significant change in size distributions of either group of teleosts. These data provide further evidence that larger, slow-maturing species have undergone declines in UK waters over the last century, and form useful benchmarks for assessment of future changes in this coastal faunal assemblage. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;CS - Western Waters;10,000-50,000;decade;0-5;year;Fisheries Dependent Data;NA;2-way Analysis of Similarities (ANOSIM) _ two-dimensional Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) _ 2-way ANOVA _ Kolmogorov–Smirov two sample tests;3;3;3;NA;NA;4.2;Meta-analysis;Fish_cartilaginous;NA;NA;NA;Elasmobranchs;Catch_and_bycatch;Bycatch;number of trawls _ mean trawl duration _ number of individuals >15cm TL per hour;NA;Commercial;Nets;Gillnet;Unknown;abundance;Abundance/biomass/density;Multiple;Dramatic changes were recorded within the elasmobranchs, characterised by a reduction in abundance of all skate (Rajiidae) species, apparent extirpation of the angel shark (Squatina squatina), and large increases in the abundance of lesser-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula).

However, our knowledge of which species have changed in abundance and body size distributions, and the reasons for these changes, is limited due to a paucity of historical data. Here we report a study of long-term change in a marine fish assemblage from the inshore waters of the Western English Channel, near Plymouth. We compiled data from historic trawls undertaken between 1913 and 1922, and resurveyed those sites in 2008 and 2009. Our results revealed highly significant temporal differences in assemblage composition, but the scale of change was not consistent among taxonomic groups. Dramatic changes were recorded within the elasmobranchs, characterised by a reduction in abundance of all skate (Rajiidae) species, apparent extirpation of the angel shark (Squatina squatina), and large increases in the abundance of lesser-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula). By contrast we observed less evidence of change among 'flatfishes' (Pleuronectiformes) or 'roundfishes' (other teleosts). Changes were also observed in length-frequency distributions, with a significant decline in the size distribution of elasmobranchs (excluding S. canicula), but no significant change in size distributions of either group of teleosts.

An analysis of the MRF on the West coasts of the Adriatic Sea was carried out, in 2014, by using a standardized questionnaires approach, aiming to describe the state of the art and to preliminarily assess catches, in comparison with the commercial ones, at the regional scale. Gilt-headed seabream, European seabass, cuttlefish, squid and Atlantic bluefin tuna resulted the anglers' preferred species, even if the top five in term of caught biomass were bluefin tuna, seabream, cuttlefish, common dolphinfish and little tunny, in the order (accounting up to 60% of total catches). The exploitation level resulted to be significant, as confirmed by the comparison with commercial fisheries, being the MRF captures 30% or 45% of the artisanal fishery in the same area, with some species, such as bluefish, bonito, pandora and picarel, showing larger values. The preliminary assessment of ecological effects, highlighted that the exploitation use about 10%-16% of energy fixed by the primary production (Primary Production Required to sustain fishery), but the ecosystem effects are still sustainable (Lindex and probability to be sustainable fished).

This study examined patterns of association of a population of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) around Lampedusa Island (Italy) during 1996-2006 and tested the hypothesis that the trawl fishery and the presence of an aquaculture farm could affect such patterns. Here, we used measures of association between pairs of individuals to assess this impact on social unit composition/cohesion and some analytical techniques to describe the structure of dolphin social networks and temporal stability of associations. Association information for 71 regularly sighted individuals was obtained from photo-identification surveys within groups observed or not at ""feeding stations.""

The Lampedusa population seems to be arranged into 6 clusters and organized in communities composed of animals that were either never seen in association with feeding stations (N individuals) or those that are (Y individuals), although mixed assemblages were also recorded.

The influence of some environmental variables (sea surface temperature, wind speed, NAO index) and some fishing effort indices (fishing days, mean size and mean engine power of the trawl vessels) was analysed as well. The species considered for the study were Eledone cirrhosa, Merluccius merluccius, Mullus barbatus, Nephrops norvegicus and Parapenaeus longirostris. From 1991 to 2006, the mean monthly landing rates were computed from the data collected at the auction of Porto Santo Stefano, the most important fishing harbour in the area.A second data set was represented by trawl survey data: two experimental trawl surveys per year have been carried out in the framework of national and international programs on the assessment of demersal resources. The mean biomass (kg/km2) indices were calculated. The time series analyses were carried out by means of Min/Max Auto-correlation Factor Analysis (MAFA) and Dynamic Factor Analysis (DFA). The two techniques provided coherent results, indicating that the two most important trends in the response variables are an increase in terms of both LPUE and survey biomass index, and a fluctuating pattern, even though characterized by a general increasing tendency.

We conducted a comparative ecosystem analysis of the Georges Bank and North Sea fish communities to determine the extent to which biological diversity is restored when fishing pressure is reduced. First, fishing mortality estimates were combined to quantify the community-level intensity and selectivity of fishing pressure. Second, standardized bottom-trawl survey data were used to investigate the temporal trends in community metrics. Third, a size-based, multispecies model (LeMans) was simulated to test the response of community metrics to both hypothetical and observed changes in fishing pressure in the two communities. These temperate North Atlantic fish communities have much in common, including a history of overfishing. In recent decades fishing pressure has been reduced, and some species have started to rebuild. The Georges Bank fishery has been more selective, and fishing pressure was reduced sooner. The two communities have similar levels of size diversity and biomass per unit area, but fundamentally different community structure. The North Sea is dominated by smaller species and has lower evenness than Georges Bank. These fundamental differences in community structure are not explained by recent fishing patterns. The multispecies model was able to predict the observed changes in community metrics better on Georges Bank, where rebuilding is more apparent than in the North Sea. Model simulations predicted hysteresis in rebuilding community metrics toward their unfished levels, particularly in the North Sea. Species in the community rebuild at different rates, with smaller prey species outpacing their large predators and overshooting their pre-exploitation abundances.

These ecosystems face many pressures, of which fishing is one of the most important. While consequences of global warming on commercial species are studied extensively, the importance of the increase in bottom temperature and of variation in fishing effort is more rarely considered together in these exploited ecosystems. Using a 17 year time series from an international bottom trawl survey, we investigated covariations of an entire demersal ecosystem (101 taxa) with the environment in the Celtic Sea. Our results showed that over the past two decades, biotic communities in the Celtic Sea were likely controlled more by environmental variables than fisheries, probably due to its long history of exploitation. At the scale of the entire zone, relations between taxa and the environment remained stable over the years, but at a local scale, in the center of the Celtic Sea, dynamics were probably driven by interannual variation in temperature. Fishing was an important factor structuring species assemblages at the beginning of the time series (2000) but decreased in importance after 2009. This was most likely caused by a change in spatial distribution of fishing effort, following a change in targeted taxa from nephrops to deeper water anglerfish that did not covary with fishing effort. Increasing bottom temperatures could induce additional changes in the coming years, notably in the cold-water commercial species cod, hake, nephrops, and American plaice. We showed that analyzing covariation is an effective way to screen a large number of taxa and highlight those that may be most susceptible to future simultaneous increases in temperature and changes in exploitation pattern by fisheries.

These ecosystems face many pressures, of which fishing is one of the most important. While consequences of global warming on commercial species are studied extensively, the importance of the increase in bottom temperature and of variation in fishing effort is more rarely considered together in these exploited ecosystems. Using a 17 year time series from an international bottom trawl survey, we investigated covariations of an entire demersal ecosystem (101 taxa) with the environment in the Celtic Sea. Our results showed that over the past two decades, biotic communities in the Celtic Sea were likely controlled more by environmental variables than fisheries, probably due to its long history of exploitation. At the scale of the entire zone, relations between taxa and the environment remained stable over the years, but at a local scale, in the center of the Celtic Sea, dynamics were probably driven by interannual variation in temperature. Fishing was an important factor structuring species assemblages at the beginning of the time series (2000) but decreased in importance after 2009. This was most likely caused by a change in spatial distribution of fishing effort, following a change in targeted taxa from nephrops to deeper water anglerfish that did not covary with fishing effort. Increasing bottom temperatures could induce additional changes in the coming years, notably in the cold-water commercial species cod, hake, nephrops, and American plaice. We showed that analyzing covariation is an effective way to screen a large number of taxa and highlight those that may be most susceptible to future simultaneous increases in temperature and changes in exploitation pattern by fisheries.

Previous studies in this area reported a survival rate between 30% and 51%, but the experiments were done on a limited monitoring period and the seasonal variations were not investigated. This study was designed to obtain a reliable value for survival rate after a 14-day monitoring period in onshore tanks allowing considering delayed mortality. The study also tested the effect on the survival rate of using a discarding chute system, a sorting device that was made mandatory on the 1st of January 2017 for Nephrops trawlers in the Bay of Biscay. This device, which enables fishermen to discard undersized Nephrops back to the sea while sorting, led to an increased average survival rate (51.2%) compared with the standard sorting practice (36.9%). The impact of biological, environmental and fishing operation related variables on survival from the first day of captivity to the end of the monitoring period was examined using a generalized linear model. The results of the GLM indicate that injuries, season and duration of the air exposure, significantly influence the survival from the 1st day of captivity to the end of the monitoring period. The survival rate was higher for non-injured Nephrops as well as for Nephrops that have undergone short air exposure, in summer and autumn. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.;English;Article;All Open Access, Green;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Anastasopoulou

The model was fitted to a combined Scottish groundfish survey biomass index, to proportion-by-length category data from both trawl surveys and commercial catch sampling from target and non-target fisheries, and to fecundity data. The model was run from 1905 to better reflect virgin conditions and to allow early fecundity data to be fitted in order to estimate the extent of density dependence in pup production. The model estimated 2010 population levels to be about 23% relative to 1955 and 19% relative to 1905.

In commercial fisheries attention is increasingly directed to species historically being of secondary importance and potentially being influenced by these drivers. We present long-term commercial fisheries data of North Sea whiting (Merlangius merlangus), comprising international catches (1903-2010), quotas (1980-2010), and British otter trawler data (landings-per-unit-effort (lpue) for 1923-2009 at the spatial scale of ICES rectangles). Based on lpue data, we tested the possible effects of climate change and fishing pressure on whiting distribution. Results showed no distinct latitudinal and deepening shifts, but a ~1° westward shift between the late-1940s and 1960s. Relations to climate change and fishing pressure were not strong. The lack of clear latitudinal and deepening shifts contrasts with recent studies on other North Sea species reporting such shifts related to temperature change. The North Sea is at the centre of the distribution range of whiting, and the temperature changes might still fall well within the physiological tolerance limits of this species, hence not affecting the distribution. The drivers for the longitudinal shift remain unclear. However, whiting is also commonly discarded by fisheries;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Using two North Sea prohibited trawling areas (PTAs) established > 80 years ago, social (fishers' perceptions), management (fishing effort and compliance) and ecological (fish abundance and size) data were combined to assess the PTAs against their primary societal (conflict resolution) and secondary ecological (stock protection) objectives. Fishers perceived that the PTAs resolved conflicts between static and mobile gear sectors, despite evidence of non-compliance. However, few fishers perceived that they personally benefited from the PTAs. Fish abundance and size data from baited traps (BT) and video (BV) provided no evidence of PTA effects, but trawling effort was a significant predictor of BT fish abundance data and improved the model of BV fish abundance data. The absence of PTA effects on fish is attributable to non-compliance, the high mobility of the fish involved and their continued exploitation within the PTAs using static gear. This points to the need for greater understanding of the behaviour of fishers in relation to closures. The study also highlights the challenges of quantifying possible fishery benefits of small temperate closed areas and questions whether widely advocated fishery benefits may have enhanced initial support, but failure to deliver them may erode faith in such closures as a fisheries management tool. © Copyright Foundation for Environmental Conservation 2012.;English;Article;;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Anastasopoulou

Nowadays, it is only a minor bycatch. Up to the mid-1970s, more than 15 000 t of blackspot sea bream were landed annually in Spanish and French ports. Thereafter, catches declined sharply from 1975 to 1985 and have stayed at low levels ever since. Here, the full history of the fishery collapse is described, using time-series of landings dating back to the early 1900s. Fishing mortalities of the main demersal stocks (hake, anglerfish, sole) were in the range 0.2-0.5 during the last 30 years. It is likely that the blackspot sea bream stock was exploited at a similar level, which is shown here to be unsustainable. The blackspot sea bream is highly sensitive to overfishing because of its protandrous hermaphroditism, with late first maturity (8 years) as females and rather low productivity. According to a yield-per-recruit model, the biomass of fecund females (BFF) is reduced to <20% of virgin BFF for a fishing mortality around 0.2. A dynamic model assuming a simple stock-recruitment relationship fitted to the reconstructed landings explained the collapse, with estimated fishing mortalities never exceeding 0.5. © 2010 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Also, the development of the fishery and the biology of the shrimp population exploited from 1992 to 1997 is analysed. The red shrimp (Aristeus antennatus) is one of the most important resources of bottom trawling in the Balearic Islands. It is fished on the slope between depths of 400 to 800 m. In biomass, it represents an average of 5% of the overall catches, but its economic value is 30% of the total earnings of the fishery. From 1948 to 1997, the landing increased at an average rate of 3405 kg per year. However, this increment was not constant for the whole period, and has been decreasing in the last five years. The engine power of boats fishing on the slope of the Balearic Islands doubled from the 1970s until the end of the study. At the moment, the number of fishing units is decreasing, although the power of the individual boats is increasing continuously. The trawl yields varied between 3 and 14 kg/h. The highest yields occurred in winter and spring. The decline of the sizes at first capture in 1997 and the increase of juveniles in the catches can be interpreted as a change in the fishery strategy, which has increased the exploitation effort on the small sizes.;English;Article;;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Anastasopoulou

The plastic abundance and composition in gastrointestinal tracts of the bogue was assess, in order to improve the knowledge on spatial-temporal variability of microplastics pollution in the Mediterranean basin and in particular, in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea. In a total of 65 specimens, 180 particles of plastic (2.8 items/specimens), mainly belonging to microplastics class, were found. Fragments (63%) and fibres (30%) were the predominant shape categories. Eleven polymers were identified: polypropylene and polyethylene were the most abundant. Several synthetic polymers belonging to the class of elastomers were also observed. The study area is strongly influenced by the absence of trawl fishing activities and a low mixing level of the seabed that, together with the confluence of different watercourses and the presence of different kind of anthropic impact, including motorway, could make it a ‘waste disposal site’.

This study evaluated if inserting a 200 mm mesh size top-panel in the last three sections of the tapered upper belly section of the trawl could reduce bycatch of juveniles while maintaining the catch efficiency for deep-water shrimp. The bycatch species investigated were Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), redfish (Sebastes spp.) and polar cod (Boreogadus saida). The bycatch of Greenland halibut and the smallest polar cod was significantly reduced, while no effect was found for redfish. The large mesh panel did not lead to a significant loss of deep-water shrimp.

Sampling was conducted seasonally in May 2014, August, October, and February 2015 using an otter trawl at depths of 10, 25, 75, 125 and 200 m along three transects. A total of 59 species were identified comprising 53 decapods (Eumalacostraca: Eucarida), 3 isopods (Eumalacostraca: Peracarida), and 3 stomatopods (Hoplocarida). Eighteen of the total identifiable species were invasive, and some of them significantly influenced the crustacean community structure. Parapenaeus longirostris, Pagurus prideaux, Charybdis (Goniohellenus) longicollis and Medorippe lanata were the most common species. Parasquilla ferussaci was reported for the first time in Turkish water of the Levantine Sea. Community structure showed seasonal patterns and differed along the depth gradient of habitat heterogeneity. The megabenthic crustacean assemblage was driven mainly by seafloor depth and was related to the fishing disturbance in the area (fishing/no-fishing zones). Environmental parameters were measured for each sample and tested in relationship to crustacean abundance by multivariate analysis CCA (canonical correspondence analysis). The results revealed significant differences in community structure related to substrate and the fine fraction of the bioseston. © 2021.

The areas represent typical shallow seas siliciclastic habitats in variable distance to the coastline. Their seabed substrate is dominated by coarse silt close to the shore and by fine sand in the most distal area on the Dogger Bank. The study documents the utility of the multibeam as a suitable tool to map large seafloor areas, as well as to quantify and qualify the footprints of the fishing groundgear. Besides the depth and amplitude information, the multibeam data allows the analysis of the incidence angle-dependent variation of the backscatter signal that provides additional information on the seabed impedance, roughness, volume scatter and substrate type. Two main types of destructive seafloor pattern were observed in the three areas. The dominant type are pairs of parallel furrows exhibiting widths of 6–9 m and depths of 2–6 cm and is related to beam trawling. Separation distance of the pair furrows is 16–23 m. The second type are pairs of narrow furrows (3–4 m) with much larger separation distance of 110–120 m. They are attributed to otter board trawling. A comparison of their mechanical ramification shows that the fishing gear incises the seafloor and modifies seafloor structures and properties. Our investigation documents that beam trawling has the greatest physical impact and exhibits the highest furrow density in the three study areas. The created furrows can persist for at least 4 months in a substrate of very fine sand. Depending on the hydrodynamic regime, the furrows can be later refilled by finer sediments, or levelled out by storm wave-induced turbulence reaching the seafloor. The hydrofoils used in otter trawl to spread the net likewise incise the seafloor, but the furrows are much narrower.

The areas represent typical shallow seas siliciclastic habitats in variable distance to the coastline. Their seabed substrate is dominated by coarse silt close to the shore and by fine sand in the most distal area on the Dogger Bank. The study documents the utility of the multibeam as a suitable tool to map large seafloor areas, as well as to quantify and qualify the footprints of the fishing groundgear. Besides the depth and amplitude information, the multibeam data allows the analysis of the incidence angle-dependent variation of the backscatter signal that provides additional information on the seabed impedance, roughness, volume scatter and substrate type. Two main types of destructive seafloor pattern were observed in the three areas. The dominant type are pairs of parallel furrows exhibiting widths of 6–9 m and depths of 2–6 cm and is related to beam trawling. Separation distance of the pair furrows is 16–23 m. The second type are pairs of narrow furrows (3–4 m) with much larger separation distance of 110–120 m. They are attributed to otter board trawling. A comparison of their mechanical ramification shows that the fishing gear incises the seafloor and modifies seafloor structures and properties. Our investigation documents that beam trawling has the greatest physical impact and exhibits the highest furrow density in the three study areas. The created furrows can persist for at least 4 months in a substrate of very fine sand. Depending on the hydrodynamic regime, the furrows can be later refilled by finer sediments, or levelled out by storm wave-induced turbulence reaching the seafloor. The hydrofoils used in otter trawl to spread the net likewise incise the seafloor, but the furrows are much narrower.

We use life-history parameters and knowledge of fish shape and habitat to estimate the sensitivity of 270 species in the Northeast Atlantic to demersal trawling and compare sensitivity to the most recent IUCN categorization. Species classified as threatened were on average significantly more sensitive to trawling than other species. Using trawl surveys in European Atlantic waters from 36°N to 62°N, we estimated indicators of abundance of 31 highly sensitive species and compared changes in abundance to sensitivity, management measures, and value of landings. The abundance of 23 of the 31 sensitive species increased after year 2000 with 14 of the species showing increases significant at the 5% level. The increases were not due to specific management measures, as less than half of the species were covered by catch limits. Furthermore, sensitivity or value of landings was not related to trends in abundance. Three species (Atlantic wolf-fish, tusk and starry ray) declined significantly. These species are all at their southern distributional limit in the North Sea. Synthesis and applications. We recommend monitoring the development of sensitive species to identify species under pressure and allow rapid management actions before species enter the IUCN threatened category.

Statistical analysis show that the mean abundance differed between surveys, generally ranging from 26 ± 68 to 80 ± 133 kg/km2. A typology of SMD indicates that plastic represented 73% of the debris collected, followed by rubber (12%), textile (8%), metal (3%), glass (0.32%), and some unidentified materials (2.70%). Analysis of results shows that the abundance and the distribution of SMD were strongly influenced by the local anthropogenic activities and by rivers inputs.

However, this assumption is rarely tested in the field. This study aimed to determine the composition of non-target species that occur in crustacean pots and to assess spatial and temporal differences in catches in the waters around the Isle of Man, Irish Sea. The data were collected using fishery independent surveys and a questionnaire study. Based on fishery independent surveys, a total of five taxonomic groups and 43 species occurred as by-catch. The dominant by-catch species was velvet crab Necora puber. The by-catch per unit effort (BPUE) for all of the non-target species was low particularly in comparison to towed bottom gear fisheries around the Isle of Man. BPUE of species composition varied considerably between different locations around the Isle of Man. The results of both the fishery independent and questionnaire data suggested that the by-catch rates varied with season with peak BPUE occurring in spring which then declined into autumn and winter. By-catch composition did not decrease significantly with an increasing target species catch. Overall, by-catch was low relative to target species catch which may be partially attributable to the use of escape panels in pot fisheries in the Isle of Man. © Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom 2017.;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;CS - Western Waters;50,000-100,000;year;5,000-10,000;quarter;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;Taxonomic identification _ Bycatch per Unit Effort;2;2;3;NA;NA;None;Field experiment;Benthos;Benthic_epifauna;Other;NA;Mainly crustaceans;Catch_and_bycatch;Non-target;Crab pot fishery effort (number of pots);NA;Commercial;Pots;NA;Crustaceans;Bycatch composition;Community composition;Negative;Moderate.

The canyon axis and flanks, as well as the adjacent open slope, were sampled at water depths ranging from 300 m to 2200 m. Grain size, dry bulk density, and 210Pb concentration profiles were measured to assess possible changes in sedimentation rates over the last century and their temporal and spatial relationship to bottom trawling effort. Sedimentation rates in the upper canyon axis (900–1200 m) had the highest rates of 0.9–2.1 cm·yr-1, quantified since the 1970s. Farther downcanyon, sedimentation rates increased two to five times after the 1970s, from 0.1–0.2 cm·yr-1 to 0.2–0.8 cm·yr-1, which coincides with a rapid growth of the total engine power of the fishing fleet operating in the study area. The enhanced sedimentation rates occur downslope of the main fishing grounds and decrease downcanyon as the distance from trawling grounds increases. These results highlight the ability of bottom trawling to resuspend bottom sediments, leading to net erosion of the canyon rims and flanks. In turn, large volumes of sediment are advected towards the canyon's interior, ultimately increasing sediment deposition along the canyon axis. Natural sedimentation rates at similar along-canyon distance from shore in the untrawled continental slope (900–1500 m) and in the lower canyon axis (1500–2200 m) are comparable (0.08–0.20 cm·yr-1), suggesting distance from coastal sediment sources as the main control on regional sedimentation in deeper parts of the margin. While submarine canyons have been regarded as preferential cross-margin conduits for sediment dispersal, they can also potentially function as modern depocenters for trawling-induced sedimentation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd;English;Article;NA;Scopus;NA;Mediterranean - non CS;50,000-100,000;two year;1,000-5,000;year;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;Sedimentological analyses;2;2;3;NA;Dont really know if increasing sedimentation rate is good or bad;4.3;Fisheries independent survey;Physical_habitats;NA;NA;NA;NA;Physical disturbance of the seabed;NA;Trawling activity in terms of spatial distribution;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;NA;NA;Sedimentation rate;Other;Negative;Sedimentation rates are substantially higher in fishing zones, as a consequence of trawling-derived sediment resuspension. ;Astarloa

We investigated the year-to-year length-based estimates of the spawning potential ratio (SPR) of European hake, a species with moderate data availability (i.e., reasonable knowledge of the life-history traits and temporal length structures of the population). We explore the effects of considering fast- vs. slow-growth hypotheses and the uncertainties of input parameters on the annual estimates of the SPR (1998–2010) in a bottom trawl fishery in the SW Mediterranean (Murcia region). The SPR estimates under four life-history scenarios were sensitive to the quality (sample size) of the length frequencies. Consequently, comparable and more accurate SPR estimates were often found for annual samples larger than 2000 individuals. The F/M ratio varied less when size compositions were grouped by period, suggesting there are transitory-population size structures. The SPR estimates were insensitive to the underlying growth hypothesis since similar M/k ratios >2.3 were derived from the four sets of von Bertalanffy growth parameters. The assessment indicated overexploitation of hake (F/M > 2, SPR < 10%) that is comparable with that derived from conventional assessments for this species elsewhere in the Mediterranean Sea. According to our findings, the LB-SPR method can provide reliable stock assessments and allows population trends to be calculated for data-limited species. However, this method requires a good understanding of the input data and their possible sources of bias. © 2018;English;Article;All Open Access, Green;Scopus;NA;Mediterranean - non CS;>100,000;decade;10,000-50,000;year;Fisheries Dependent Data;NA;Size frequency analysis _ LB-SPR method/model;2;2;3;NA;NA;None;Modelling/simulation;Fish_teleost;Demersal;NA;NA;Merluccius merluccius;Catch_and_bycatch;Target;Fishing mortality;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;NA; ;Spawning potential ratio (SPR);Reproduction;Negative;SPR below 10%, which means overexploitation;Astarloa

We conducted a multi-annual survey on litter at the sea surface and on the seafloor in the south-eastern North Sea. Bottom trawling was identified as a major source of marine litter. Oceanographic modelling revealed that the distribution of floating litter in the North Sea is largely determined by the site of origin of floating objects whereas the trajectories are strongly influenced by wind drag. Methods adopted from species distribution modelling indicated that resuspension of benthic litter and near-bottom transport processes strongly influence the distribution of litter on the seafloor. Major sink regions for floating marine litter were identified at the west coast of Denmark and in the Skagerrak.

In the Mediterranean Sea deep-sea coral habitats are associated with commercially important crustaceans, consequently their abundance has dramatically declined due to the effects of trawling.

In the present work, we focus on the multi-species demersal fisheries of the Aegean Sea (eastern Mediterranean) aiming to study the effects of different management measures on the main commercial stocks, as well as to explore the economic viability of the fisheries depending upon these resources, by means of simulated projections. Utilizing the limited available data, our results demonstrated that, under the current exploitation pattern, the economic viability of the fleets is threatened, particularly if fuel prices increase. Additionally, the biological targets set for the most exploited species, such as hake, will not be met under the current management regime. The projections also showed that the only management scenario under which both resource sustainability and economic viability of the fisheries are ensured is the decrease of fleet capacity in terms of vessel numbers. In this case, however, measures to support the fisheries-dependent communities need to be implemented to prevent the collapse of local economies due to employment decrease. Scenarios assuming selectivity improvements would be also beneficial for the stocks but they showed low economic performance and their application would threaten the viability of the fleets, particularly that of the trawlers. © 2016 Tserpes et al.

Two intensely trawled gulfs were compared with two gulfs from which trawling has been excluded for 15 years. The results show a significant effect of trawling on the faunal assemblage and when comparing the mean biomass and the whole isotopic composition of the benthic communities. A similar pattern, although not significant, was found for total abundance, biomass, production/biomass ratio and diversity. Higher abundance and lower biomass were found in the untrawled areas, attributable to the presence of more numerous yet smaller individuals, possibly a consequence of more abundant larger predators that are not removed by trawling, and consequent higher predatory pressure on the benthic macrofauna. The SIMPER analysis evidenced a dominance of burrowing deposit feeding worms (Paraonidae and Cossuridae) in trawled areas, as a result of increased mechanical alteration and hence more organic matter available as food. In contrast, the response to trawling as drawn by the use of trophic markers (i.e., stable isotopes) was less clear. While d15N of benthic taxa did not vary significantly between untrawled and trawled areas, d13C was higher in trawled areas possibly due to high sediment resuspension and consequent intense microbial activity. Mixing models confirmed higher reliance to a detritus-based food web for benthic organisms in the trawled areas.

Here, we use intrinsic and genetic markers to understand the impact of bycatch on the Atlantic and Mediterranean populations of the loggerhead turtle sharing the same foraging grounds in the western Mediterranean Sea. Turtles of Atlantic origin settle on the continental shelf later and at a larger size than turtles of Mediterranean origin and hence have been suggested to be more vulnerable to pelagic fishing gears, whereas those of Mediterranean origin would be more vulnerable to neritic ones. To assess whether this hypothesis holds true, we compared the genetic make-up of turtle bycatch from drifting longlines and bottom trawl/trammel nets in three different regions (eastern mainland Spain, southern Balearic Islands and southern Italy). A total of 176 incidentally caught turtles were considered, and size and habitat use, as revealed by stable isotopes, were incorporated to the analysis. No genetic, size or isotopic differences were found between turtles caught with drifting longlines and bottom trawl/trammel nets within any of the three regions. However, genetic, size and isotopic differences were detected among regions, regardless of the fishing gear. Thus, the population make-up of loggerhead bycatch depends on the area where the fishing operations are conducted, but not on the fishing gear used.

A total of 176 incidentally caught turtles were considered, and size and habitat use, as revealed by stable isotopes, were incorporated to the analysis. No genetic, size or isotopic differences were found between turtles caught with drifting longlines and bottom trawl/trammel nets within any of the three regions. However, genetic, size and isotopic differences were detected among regions, regardless of the fishing gear. Thus, the population make-up of loggerhead bycatch depends on the area where the fishing operations are conducted, but not on the fishing gear used. Accordingly, the actual impact of loggerhead bycatch in the Mediterranean Sea will depend not only on the total number of turtles taken, but also on the geographic distribution of the fishing effort. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;CS - Mediterranean;>100,000;decade;>100,000;decade;Fisheries Dependent Data;NA;Two-way ANCOVA to test differences in size;2;2;3;NA;NA;4.2;Field experiment;Reptiles;Turtles;NA;NA;Caretta caretta;Catch_and_bycatch;Bycatch;Incidental capture;NA;Commercial;Hooks_and_lines;Longline;NA;Curved caparace length;Size/age structure;No impact;No significant differences in size between gears;Astarloa

Genetic and observational evidence support the notion that this is an isolated population, separated from its Atlantic neighbours. These whales depend on mesopelagic squid for food, and appear to occupy a very similar ecological niche to sperm whales in the open oceans. Recent evidence proving that individuals can pass between the eastern and western deep water basins confirms that this is a single population, not isolated into western and eastern stocks. We lack robust information on their population status, but they could number in the hundreds rather than thousands, and current densities appear to be much lower than those reported in the 1950s, suggesting that we should be very concerned about the conservation status of this population. This makes it vitally important to address the serious threats posed by ship strikes and entanglement in fishing nets, especially driftnets, and to carefully monitor other potential sources of anthropogenic impact. A step change in funding to collect better data and a clear shift in policy priorities are needed if we are to be serious about conserving this population. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd;English;Book Chapter;;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;It just summarizes the mean threats of Sperm wahles, among others;4.2;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Astarloa

The present study aims at examining the presence of gnathiid isopods on a wild fish species, the red mullet, under the influence of trawling activity by comparing epidemiological data of trawled and no-trawled areas. The potential impact of gnathiids on the red mullet within a no-trawled area (NTA) of the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea (Central Mediterranean Sea) has been assessed examining epidemiological indices in relation to season, sex, age and host condition. The spatial distribution of prevalence in the study was heterogeneous with the bulk of gnathiids found inside the NTA. Similarly, the intensity and abundance showed values significantly higher inside the NTA than outside. Inside the NTA temporal variations of gnathiid infestation were evident, with the lowest prevalence and intensity during winter but without a seasonal pattern. Gnathiids infection is not related to the sex and age of the red mullet and does not influence negatively the host condition. The occurrence of gnathiids, despite being temporary and generalist parasites, strongly reflects the host density and site protection level.;English;Article;;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;The relation with fisheries is too distant;4.4;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Astarloa

The framework that can be used at regional and local scales provides indicators for both trawling pressure and ecological impact. It builds on high-resolution maps of trawling intensity and considers the physical effects of trawl gears on the seabed, on marine taxa, and on the functioning of the benthic ecosystem. Within the framework, a reductionist approach is applied that breaks down a fishing gear into its components, and a number of biological traits are chosen to determine either the vulnerability of the benthos to the impact of that gear component, or to provide a proxy for their ecological role. The approach considers gear elements, such as otter boards, twin trawl clump, and groundrope, and sweeps that herd the fish. The physical impact of these elements on the seabed, comprising scraping of the seabed, sediment mobilization, and penetration, is a function of the mass, size, and speed of the individual component. The impact of the elements on the benthic community is quantified using a biological-trait approach that considers the vulnerability of the benthic community to trawl impact (e.g. sediment position, morphology), the recovery rate (e.g. longevity, maturation age, reproductive characteristics, dispersal), and their ecological role. The framework is explored to compare the indicators for pressure and ecological impact of bottom trawling in three main seabed habitat types in the North Sea. Preliminary results show that the Sublittoral mud (EUNIS A5.3) is affected the most due to the combined effect of intensive fishing and large proportions of long-lived taxa. © 2015 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2015.

Current knowledge on the response of benthic communities to the impact of trawling is still rudimentary. In the present study, we used data collected in the Barents Sea during 2011 to assess the vulnerability of benthic species to trawling, based on the risk of being caught or damaged by a bottom trawl. Using trait table analysis, we identified 23 ""high-risk"" benthic species, which include ""large weight and upraised"" taxa as ""easily caught"" by a bottom trawl. We further identified a ""low-risk"" category containing 245 taxa/species and a ""medium-risk"" category with 80 species. A clear decline in biomass was noted for all three categories when comparing trawled vs. untrawled areas. This suggests that trawling significantly affects the biomass of all species, but predominantly the ""high-risk"" taxa. Some Barents Sea regions were particularly susceptible to trawling due to the dominance of the ""high-risk"" species, including Geodia sponges in the southwestern Barents Sea, basket stars (Gorgonocephalus) in the northern Barents Sea, sea pen (Umbellula encrinus) on the shelf facing the Arctic Ocean, and sea cucumber (Cucumaria frondosa) in shallow southern areas. These findings can guide management decisions to meet targets set by the United Nations Convention of Biological Diversity and the OSPAR Commission (""Protecting and Conserving the North-East Atlantic and its Resources""). We specifically recommend management action in the southwestern and the northwestern Barents Sea and on the Arctic shelf facing the Arctic Ocean. © 2015 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2015.

(ICES J Mar Sci 64:1735-1742, 2007) reported that areas in the Wadden Sea selected by mechanical cockle dredgers were of greater zoobenthic diversity than areas that remained undredged. The present paper attempts to explain this observation, focussing on the elevation-related zoning of the macrobenthic fauna on tidal Xats. Dense beds of cockles Cerastoderma edule occur in a speciWc intermediate intertidal-height zone where more species are present (and reach their maximal abundance) than in either lower or higher zones. This coincidence of preferred intertidal zones in many species, including cockles, may cause the higher species richness (and higher total macrozoobenthic biomass) of the Wsherchosen dredging areas as compared to other nearby nondredged tidal-Xat areas. © Springer-Verlag and AWI 2009.;English;Article;All Open Access, Bronze;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4.3;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Basurko

Of all the large cetaceans, the sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) is most affected by this fishing technique. On 9 August 2004, a group of five sperm whales, two adult females and three juvenile individuals, was found trapped in a driftnet 40 miles southwest off Capo Palinuro (Italy). Their tails were totally immobilised by the net and one animal was completely entangled. All the animals showed numerous lesions on their bodies. The group was freed by the Italian Coast Guard scuba-diving team during a two-day rescue operation. This exceptional case of sperm whale disentanglement was a unique opportunity to study the group's acoustic and general behaviour during a particularly stressful event. Out of a total video/acoustic recording of 110 minutes, 91 were examined. During the rescue procedures, the whales' behaviour was described as open mouthed, sideways roll, agitation of fluke and pectoral fins, head rubbing, fluke contact (with head, flippers and back by the liberated animals) and defecation. As expected, the entangled individuals produced different patterns of clicks, identified as 'usual clicks', 'codas' and 'creaks'. Each pattern was associated with specific behaviour. Despite international and national regulation banning fishing with driftnets in the Mediterranean Sea, driftnets continue to be used illegally in this sperm whale habitat, posing a constant threat to the species' survival in the region.;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;Mediterranean - non CS;500-1,000;week;0-5;day;Behavioural Observations;video/acoustic recording;MATLAB _ Rainbow Click software package ;2;2;3;Entangled sperm whale individuals produced different patterns of clicks, identified as ‘usual clicks’, ‘codas’ and ‘creaks’.

Surveys were conducted in 8 MPAs by various sampling methods (visual surveys by SCUBA diving, anaesthetic catch, poisoning, fishing nets or fishing lines): Port-Cros (France), Lavezzi and Scandola (Corse, France), Monaco, Mèdes Islands (Spain), Tremiti, Torre Guaceto and Porto Cesareo (Italy). These areas presented similar biotopes (rocky substrata, Posidonia oceanica beds and sandy bottoms) but different ages (1963, Port-Cros to 1997, Porto Cesareo) and sizes (418 ha at Mèdes Islands to 16600 at Porto Cesáreo), Tremiti and Porto Cesareo have a weak protection compared to the other MPAs considered. The first step of this work was to update surveys already published by including new observations and unpublished data. Surveys were then compared using two diversity indexes, Average Taxonomic Distinctness (AvTD) and Variation in Taxonomie Distinctness (VarTD). For each MPA, these indexes have been compared to theoretical values for the Mediterranean Sea. This theoretical value (331 species belonging to 94 families) was calculated from the total number of species reported in the Mediterranean (FishBase) without the lessepsian species, species inhabiting deep waters (more than 100 m depth), and sub-species. A total of 215 (Port-Cros), 198 (Scandola), 191 Lavezzi, 136 (Mèdes), 108 (Monaco), 105 (Torre Guaceto), 75 (Tremiti and Porto Cesareo) species have been reported in the different MPAs. Number of species found in Port-Cros, Scandola and Lavezzi corresponded to the diversity expected for Mediterranean fish samples: i.e. the diversity expected from a sample of nspecies (215, 198 or 191 species respectively) drawn at random from the total list (331 species). VarTD of all the well protected zones corresponded also to the Mediterranean expected values. Therefore, well protected areas allowed preservation of taxonomic relationships between species.

According to historical data there has been a steady decrease of all the populations since the 1940s. Seven taxa now extinct (Cystoseira crinita, Cystoseira barbata, Cystoseira foeniculacea f. tenuiramosa, Cystoseira spinosa, Cystoseira spinosa var. compressa, Sargassum hornschuchii and Sargassum vulgare) were considered frequent and some of them were the dominant and engineering species in several phytobenthic assemblages. Moreover, only one of the five species left, shows no signs of regression (Cystoseira compressa), two are considered as rare (Cystoseira caespitosa, Cystoseira zosteroides), and one is very rare (Cystoseira elegans). Cystoseira mediterranea, a species that was reported to make a continuous belt along the shores of the Albères coast, has almost disappeared from some areas. Overgrazing by sea urchins, outcompetition by mussels, habitat destruction, scientific research sampling and, probably, human trampling and chemical pollution are to be blamed for the decline of populations thriving in shallow waters. Deep-water species have been affected by an increase in water turbidity and, probably, chemical pollution and direct plant destruction attributed to net fishing. If degradation of the environmental conditions continues, the remaining Cystoseira species will face a most unwelcome prospect. Even after the removal of the causes that led to its die-off, natural restoration of extinct species seems not to be possible because the decline has also affected populations from nearby areas and zygotes are unable to disperse over long distances. Urgent management actions have to be designed in order to improve the current situation of the populations of Fucales in the Albères coast. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

They were also collected between 1996 and 1998 in the river to estimate the number of ascending salmon. These data on spawners were used to study the effect of changing fishing regulations in the Finnish coastal fishery in the mid-1990s on the structure of the spawning stock. In total, 1.9% of 2290 multi-sea-winter adults had previously spawned. The average annual proportion of repeat spawners was 0.5% between 1990 and 1996, but significantly higher (2.8%) between 1997 and 2003. The age distribution also changed significantly, as 4SW and 5SW salmon appeared in the population in the latter years. These changes were most probably due to the application of stricter fishing regulations. The potential of salmon to spawn repeatedly was thus preserved, despite a severe decline in natural production in the 1980s and early 1990s. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;English;Article;;Scopus;EXCLUDE on environment;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;None;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Basurko

In these areas, fishing pressure is very high, since approximately 50% of the Greek otter trawl fleet operates there, producing more than 57% of the total demersal landings. Different statistics were used to assess spatial structure, seasonal changes and diversity of the demersal fish assemblages on the continental shelf and upper slope. The following measures were applied to the species abundance matrix: species diversity, species richness, evenness and dominance. The analysis of 501 bottom trawls revealed that, in general, species diversity, richness and evenness decreased with water depth, with the highest values at depths <100 m, whereas dominance increased with depth, with its maximum at depths >200 m. The effect of depth on the diversity patterns observed was always significant, while seasonal trends were similar with those described for the overall diversity characteristics in each area. Classification and ordination methods showed the existence of 4 groups associated with the continental shelf and upper slope in each area. Classification of the top ranking species at each group and area revealed that commercially important species were dominant in the shallowest zone (<30 m), while non-commercial species predominated at depths below 200 m. At intermediate depths (30-200 m) almost 50% of the total catches were composed of non-commercially important fish species. However, since most species had a wide distribution range these differences were rather quantitative than qualitative. The results indicated that although spatial changes in abundance could be detected, temporal changes were not obvious. Environmental variability and overexploitation, as well as differences in species' life-history strategies, have both influenced the structure of the demersal fish assemblages found along the depth gradient studied.;Spanish;Article;All Open Access, Gold, Green;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;CS - Mediterranean;>100,000;two year;10,000-50,000;quarter;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;Bray–Curtis similarity index, PRIMER algorithms, Multidimensional scaling (MDS), SIMPER procesure, graphical representations of species cumulative frequency distributions, ABC method of Warwick, _ Shannon-Wiener diversity index _ species richness, eveness, Simpson's index _ Tukey post-hoc comparison test;2;2;2;NA;NA;4.4;Fisheries independent survey;Fish_teleost;Demersal;NA;NA;NA;Catch_and_bycatch;Target;NA;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;Otter trawl;NA;Abundance (species diversity, species richness, evenness, dominance);Abundance/biomass/density;Negative;Overfishing has affected the population structures and densities of the demersal fish communities, at least at depths up to 200m, where most of the fishing activity is focused.;Basurko

The Finnish national regulation of salmon fishing in the Baltic Sea has changed considerably during recent decades: regulation was slight until 1996, strict in 1996-1997 and moderate from 1998 onwards. The wild/reared ratio was lower in smolts than in returning multi-sea-winter (MSW) spawners at the river mouth, indicating at least two times higher marine survival of wild smolts compared with reared ones. The catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of MSW spawning migrants in the trap net fishery of brood fish at the river mouth differed significantly between the slight, strict and moderate regulation periods, the CPUE being highest under strict regulation. The river catches of salmon were significantly lower during the period of slight regulation than later, while recoveries of tagged salmon in the Simojoki river were highest during the period of strict regulation. The results suggest that strict regulation of fishing is a very effective way of safeguarding the salmon stock, but even a short relief in the opening dates of the sea fishing season significantly reduced the spawning run into the river. The considerable proportion of reared fish among the ascending salmon indicates that stocking has increased the spawning run into the river. This has been important, especially during the years of low natural reproduction. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The concept presupposes that good recruitment of herring and cod is linked to warm ocean climate, which may occur with a frequency of 8 to 10 years. Strong herring year classes overlap the distribution of capelin larvae in 3-4 years causing mass mortality of the capelin fry, and depletion of the capelin stock. At the same time the herring is about to leave the Barents Sea, and lack of food in subsequent years reduces the potential yield of cod. Immature cod is the main predator on mature capelin and cannibalism is an important factor in reducing the abundance of juvenile cod when the capelin stock is rebuilding. The model is used in a study of the effects of different fishery management strategies on stocks and yield. Results show that optimum yield of cod is obtained by high fishing mortality on immature cod from the end of a warm period until the spawning stock of capelin is rebuilt. This fishing strategy will result in large fluctuation in the yearly cod catches but yield an optimum average biomass production of capelin and an optimum potential catch of cod. These results are in accordance with the catch history of cod. Prior to the 1970s, the effort of the fishery in the Barents Sea followed to a large extent the abundance of immature cod, resulting in large catches when the stock was abundant. The yearly catches varied from 0.4 to 1.3 million tonnes, but the average catch obtained in the two periods 1950-1958 and 1959-1969 are the highest on record. Moreover, the trawlers fished with small meshes in the cod end, discarding considerable quantities of the smallest fish.

Scyliorhinus canigula and skates beneftit most from discarding in the studied area, though it has to be borne in mind that such species have become very abundant in the area since the closure of the trawl fishery.;Basurko

The study period of one year (July 1998-June 1999) included a monthly collection of data on commercial landings, fishing effort and length distribution of O. vulgaris. Many gears exploit this species in both areas. Specialised and highly productive artisanal gears (fyke nets, pots and traps) have been developed.

Altogether 241 stations were sampled covering 143 ICES rectangles. The objectives of the projects were (i) to analyse epibenthic diversity patterns in the North Sea, (ii) to identify the spatial distribution of faunal communities and (iii) to relate environmental factors as well as fishing effort to species diversity. Epibenthic fauna was clearly divided between the southern North Sea and the central-northern North Sea, roughly along the 50 m depth line. The separation was based on an overall higher number of species in the central and northern North Sea and a change in the species composition from north to south. Sessile fauna including erect, branching species like bryozoans and hydrozoans were particularly diverse along a corridor in the central-northern North Sea between 56° and 58°N, coinciding with the area between the 50 m and 100 m depth line. Cluster analysis, based on the structure of the community, confirmed the north-south gradient found for species diversity. Separation of clusters was driven to a great extent by species occurring predominantly or exclusively north of the 50 m contour line. Few species were exclusive to the south, but a number of scavenging species were found here more frequently and in higher numbers. Depth was positively correlated with the diversity of free-living fauna, whereas the type of sediment showed no significant relationship with variations in numbers of species.

The relative abundances of two highly sought after spearfishing target-fish species, Dicentrarchus labrax (Linnaeus 1758) and Sparus aurata Linnaeus 1758, were compared using underwater visual censuses in shallow (< 5 m) inshore waters along rocky shores inside and outside a marine reserve area in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea (Banyuls-sur-Mer region, France). 2. The relative abundances of these two species were consistently lower outside the reserve area, which comprised around 40% of the 25.6 km of inshore coastal waters surveyed. 3. The demographic structure of D. labrax was also different inside and outside the protected area, the proportion of larger fish being significantly higher in the marine reserve. 4. The direct and indirect impacts of spearfishing are postulated to explain the distributional and population structural characteristics of these two species in the shallow waters off this rocky coast. 5. Prohibition of spearfishing has favoured the persistence of these species during summer (the main spearfishing season) in the shallower inshore waters inside the area of the Cerbére/Banyuls-sur-Mer marine reserve. 6.

Their massive populations may vary radically in size under intensive exploitation. We have used decadal-scale time series to explore patterns of interactions between these fish, their prey, and their predators so as to quantify functional roles of small pelagic fish in those ecosystems. Top-down control of zooplankton is detected off South Africa, Ghana, Japan, and in the Black Sea. Conversely, bottom-up control of predators, such as predatory fish and marine birds, is observed in the Benguela, Guinea, and Humboldt currents. Thus small pelagic fish exert a major control on the trophic dynamics of upwelling ecosystems and constitute midtrophic-level 'wasp-waist' populations. Ecosystem effects of fishing are addressed by considering potential structural changes at different scales of observation, ranging from individuals, via school dynamics, to food webs. The overall impact is explored using a trophic model (Ecosim) given different types of food web control. Ecosystem dynamics can be entirely different depending on how the food web is controlled (bottom-up, top-down or wasp-waist). The threat of eroding intra-specific diversity is emphasized because it may lead to a long-term decline in the productivity of the pelagic fish resources. School composition is shown to reflect the relative species abundance within the pelagic community and functions as a 'school trap' that could maintain a collapsed population in a depleted state for lengthy periods, and affect spatial dynamics such as migrations. As a result, overfishing can alter the abundance, composition, and distribution in pelagic communities, and may induce drastic changes of state. Predation on zooplankton by the jack mackerel (Trachurus symmetricus murphyi) population in the South Pacific provides an example of the alteration of matter fluxes in trophic webs caused by fishery removals. In conclusion, it is doubtful that pelagic fisheries will continue to increase without major disruptions to ecosystems.

One of the direct physical impacts is the mobilization of sediment in the wake of trawl gear components that are in contact with or are close to the seabed. The quantity of sediment mobilized is related to the hydrodynamic drag of the gear components and the type of sediment over which they are trawled. Here we present a methodology to estimate the sediment mobilization from hydrodynamic drag. The hydrodynamic drag of individual gear components is estimated using empirical measurements of similarly shaped objects, including cylinders, cubes, and nets. The method is applied to beam trawls used in the Dutch North Sea flatfish fishery and validated using measurements of beam trawl drag from the literature. Netting contributes most to the hydrodynamic drag of pulse trawls, while the tickler chains and chain mat comprise most of the hydrodynamic drag of conventional beam trawls. Taking account of the silt content of the areas trawled and the number of different beam trawl types used by the fleet, sediment mobilization is estimated as 9.2 and 5.3 kg m-2 for conventional 12 m beam and pulse trawls, respectively, and 4.2 and 4.3 kg m-2 for conventional 4.5 m beam and pulse trawls. © 2021 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2021.;English;Article;All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green;Scopus;NA;CS - North Sea;>100,000;five year;5,000-10,000;five year;Fisheries Dependent Data;NA;t-test;2;2;3;NA;More of a validation of the simulation approach to estimating impacts of gear components on benthic habitats than actually quantifying the impacts. ;4.3;Modelling/simulation;Physical_habitats;Mixed;NA;NA;NA;Physical disturbance of the seabed;NA;Hydrodynamic drag of gear components;None;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;Beam trawl;NA;Sediment mobilisation;Other;Multiple;The application of our methodology to the Dutch beam trawl fishery in the North Sea showed that the innovative pulse trawl that replaced mechanical stimulation of sole by tickler chains or chain mats with electrical stimulation reduced the hydrodynamic drag of the gear and the amount of sediments mobilized in the wake of the trawl of large trawlers but not of small trawlers.;Binch

The current study used photo-id data from 2005-2014 to estimate the skin mark pattern on resident bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from the Aeolian Archipelago (Italy). Thirteen skin mark types were identified and their origin, prevalence and permanence time were examined. The pattern of skin marks was assessed for the abundance, richness, distribution and severity in six body regions and compared among age classes, sex and degree of dolphins' interaction with trammel nets (DIN). Our results showed higher prevalence, abundance, richness and distribution of skin marks in adults than in the younger age classes, with the exception of black marks and white ring lesions. The prevalence and abundance of skin marks were higher in males than females, with the exception of scratches and white patches. Moreover, gunshot wounds, mutilations and irregular dorsal fin edges were found only on adult males. Since males showed higher DIN than females and, in dolphins with higher DIN, skin marks were more abundant and frequently distributed in different body regions, the skin mark pattern in regard to DIN seems to be sex-related. The more severe marks were observed on adults, males and dolphins with higher DIN, namely skin disorder, tooth rake marks, small shallow indentations, deep indentations and mutilations. On the contrary, the severity of scratches, white patches and dark ring lesions was higher in females than males, but not significantly related to DIN and age of the individuals. Our results showed that photo-id data provide an efficient and cost-effective approach to document the occurrence of skin marks in free-ranging bottlenose dolphin populations, a critical step toward understanding the cause and supporting the conservation strategies. © 2019 Leone et al.

Electrotrawling for brown shrimp Crangon crangon is increasingly used in shallow coastal zones and estuaries of the southern North Sea. As these fishing grounds are often important nurseries and spawning areas for various marine species, electrotrawling could therefore harm inhabiting fishes during their early life stages. Hence, this research aims to investigate the effect of electric pulses used to catch brown shrimp on the survival and development of Sole embryos and larvae. Exposure of Sole embryos at 2 d postfertilization and larvae at 11 d posthatching to pulsed DC used to catch brown shrimp did not result in a lower survival 8 d after exposure.

The model was parameterised for the Eastern English Channel demersal mixed fishery using otter trawls or dredges. Target species differed in their association with habitat types. Restricting catch quota for plaice and cod had a limited effect on benthic impact, except when reduced to very low values, forcing the vessels to stay in port. Quota management had a minimal influence on fishing behaviour and hence resulted in a minimal reduction of benthic impact. Habitat credits may reduce the benthic impacts of the trawl fisheries at a minimal loss of landings and revenue, as vessels are still able to reallocate their effort to less vulnerable fishing grounds, while allowing the fishery to catch their catch quota and maintain their revenue. Only if they are reduced to extremely low levels can habitat credits potentially constrain fishing activities to levels that prevent the fisheries from using up the catch quota for the target species. © Inter-Research 2018.;English;Article;All Open Access, Green;Scopus;NA;CS - North Sea;>100,000;two year;5,000-10,000;week;Fisheries Dependent Data;NA;GAMs _ DSVM;2;2;3;Our study shows that a complementary use of habitat credits with a catch quota could reduce benthic impact, with the fishery continuing to sustainably exploit a mix of resources.;NA;4.3;Modelling/simulation;Physical_habitats;Mixed;NA;NA;Scallops P. maximus _ Solea solea _ Pleuronectes platessa _ Gadus morhua _ Dicentrarchus labrax _ cephalopods;Physical disturbance of the seabed;NA;Fishing effort _ Catch quota _ Habitat credit;Economic drivers _ economic incentives;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;Otter trawl;French bottom trawl fleet _ Scallops P. maximus _ Pleuronectes platessa _ Gadus morhua;Effort _ Fishing ground allocation;Other;Multiple;Reduction of individual catch quotas could even result in an increase in the benthic impact _ we showed that benthic impacts can be reduced by introducing IHCs;Binch

Marine litter densities amounted to 43 ± 33 kg km-2 and 74 ± 28 items km-2, with plastics and fisheries derived litter being the most widespread categories. Litter densities generally decreased along the water depth axis. To identify possible drivers for the observed litter distribution we performed a generalised additive model, which explained 14.8% of the variance and pointed to densely populated areas, number of fishing ports, geographical sector and fishing activity as the main explanatory factors. The most important driver for the benthic litter distribution was human population, as litter density linearly increased along this variable. Similarly, the number of ports in neighbouring areas had a positive effect on litter densities. Fishing effort had a negative and non-linear effect on benthic litter density which could be explained by litter delocalization during fishing operations. We hypothesise that litter might accumulate preferentially on the periphery of rocky bottoms, out of reach for our sampling methodology. Litter distribution differed among geographical sectors, pointing to other variables such as shipping traffic and oceanographic currents, which were not explicitly considered in the analysis. Our study sets a reference level for benthic macro-litter in the southern Bay of Biscay and identifies factors driving its distribution, which can be extrapolated to other continental shelf seas. Our findings lay the foundations to develop measures aiming to reduce macro-litter densities on the seafloor. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd;English;Article;All Open Access, Green;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;CS - Western Waters;>100,000;five year;5,000-10,000;year;Regular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;GAM _ quasipoisson GAM;NA;NA;NA;NA;Doesn't describe the impact of fishing on benthic habitats, is just a classification of the litter types, distribution, and composition.

Among this very diversified genus (335 taxa accepted taxonomically), only 9 species (including the invasive S. muticum) have been reported from the Mediterranean Sea. We have analysed the changes over more than two centuries in the Sargassum’s pattern of distribution along ~2,970 km of north-western Mediterranean coasts, using all available historical sources (literature and herbarium vouchers) and 2003–2014 field surveys. Though common in the past, all the long-lived native Mediterranean species (except S.vulgare) have become extremely rare or locally extinct, while the invasive S. muticum has developed large populations in some coastal lagoons. The increase in water turbidity, trawling and fishing nets is possibly responsible for the regression of the deep populations of S. hornschuchii, S. acinarium, whereas overgrazing by sea urchins and habitat destruction (coastal development) are probably responsible for the decline of shallow populations. In contrast with the terrestrial realm, where thousands of species are protected, even some relatively common species, Mediterranean species of Sargassum that seem to have become extinct in extensive areas, such as S. acinarium and S. hornschuchii, are, surprisingly, still lacking proper protection status and inclusion on the IUCN Red List. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.;English;Article;NA;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;Mediterranean - non CS;>100,000;decade;10,000-50,000;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Doesn't describe or quantify the impacts of fishing on Sargassum decline, just says that fishing could be a cause. ;4.3;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Binch

Occurrence is assessed based on Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) video imaging. Terrain classification techniques are applied to high-resolution swath bathymetric data to obtain semi-automatic interpretative maps to identify the relationship between coral distribution patterns and canyon environments. A total of 21 ROV immersions were carried out in different canyon environments at depths ranging between 79 and 401 m. Large, healthy colonies of M. oculata occur on abrupt, protected, often overhanging, rocky sections of the canyon walls, especially in Illa Negra branch. D. cornigera is sparser and evenly distributed at depth, on relatively low sloping areas, in rocky but also partially sedimented areas. C. rubrum is most frequent between 100 and 160 m on highly sloping rocky areas. The probable extent of CWC habitats is quantified by applying a maximum entropy model to predict habitat suitability: 0.36 km2 yield M. oculata occurrence probabilities over 70%. Similar predictive models have been produced for D. cornigera and C. rubrum. All ROV transects document either the presence of litter on the seafloor or pervasive trawling marks. Nets and longlines are imaged entangled on coral colonies. Coral rubble is observed at the foot of impacted colonies. Some colonies are partially covered by sediment that could be the result of the resuspension generated by bottom trawling on neighbouring fishing grounds, which has been demonstrated to be responsible of daily increases in sediment fluxes within the canyon.

Occurrence is assessed based on Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) video imaging. Terrain classification techniques are applied to high-resolution swath bathymetric data to obtain semi-automatic interpretative maps to identify the relationship between coral distribution patterns and canyon environments. A total of 21 ROV immersions were carried out in different canyon environments at depths ranging between 79 and 401 m. Large, healthy colonies of M. oculata occur on abrupt, protected, often overhanging, rocky sections of the canyon walls, especially in Illa Negra branch. D. cornigera is sparser and evenly distributed at depth, on relatively low sloping areas, in rocky but also partially sedimented areas. C. rubrum is most frequent between 100 and 160 m on highly sloping rocky areas. The probable extent of CWC habitats is quantified by applying a maximum entropy model to predict habitat suitability: 0.36 km2 yield M. oculata occurrence probabilities over 70%. Similar predictive models have been produced for D. cornigera and C. rubrum. All ROV transects document either the presence of litter on the seafloor or pervasive trawling marks. Nets and longlines are imaged entangled on coral colonies. Coral rubble is observed at the foot of impacted colonies. Some colonies are partially covered by sediment that could be the result of the resuspension generated by bottom trawling on neighbouring fishing grounds, which has been demonstrated to be responsible of daily increases in sediment fluxes within the canyon.

Data were obtained from 199 hauls undertaken from May to June 2013 during the Spanish International Bottom Trawl Survey in the Mediterranean (MEDITS). Twenty-five different chondrichthyan species were caught in all GSAs: seven were common to all areas, five appeared only in GSA01, nine appeared only in GSA05 and one appeared only in GSA06. Analysis of community structure (clusters, multidimensional scaling, analysis of similitude) revealed two assemblages related to depth, with very similar bathymetric ranges in all GSAs, namely continental shelf (from 41 to 252m) and slope (from 284 to 813m). The highest diversity, biomass and abundance values on the shelf and slope assemblages were recorded in GSA05 and GSA01 respectively. These results highlight the effects of the distinct fishing and oceanographic parameters related to the GSAs. Generally, the biological parameters of the most important species did not show differences between GSAs, which could suggest the existence of a single population in the western Mediterranean. © CSIRO 2016.;English;Article;NA;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;Mediterranean - non CS;>100,000;month;10,000-50,000;snapshot/no repeat sampling;Regular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;ANCOVA _ MDS _ GLM _ SIMPER _ ANOSIM;2;2;3;NA;Survey of different chondrichthyes in the Western Mediterranean Sea.

A perspective on assessing these fisheries is illustrated for juvenile European hake, Merluccius merluccius, in the northwestern Mediterranean. Here, a constant natural mortality (M) assumption is incorrect, as is the assumption that high fecundities are necessarily adequate for stock replacement. The high Ms-at-age for juveniles generated by the reciprocal model are shown to be a logical counterpart to the high fecundity of hake. Charnov’s criterion of intergenerational reproductive replacement is used to test for a sustainable population, analogous to a limit reference point warning of the dangers of overfishing beyond population replacement. Once peak mortality rates of age 2 hake exceed F(2)=1.1-1.2, which is currently the case, reproductive replacement may be at risk. Adult exploitation by inshore trawls is low, and maturing hake surviving the fine-mesh trawl fishery migrate offshore with a reduced vulnerability to fine-mesh gears. Early research suggested that rough bottom near the shelf edge once formed a refugium protecting offshore spawners from trawling, and led to abundant recruitment of juveniles nearer shore. It may not do so if offshore fishing effort by reinforced bottom trawls, gill nets and longlines is uncontrolled. Restoring offshore refugia to protect spawners and controlling peak fishing mortality of juveniles would be a precautionary strategy aimed at restoring previous levels of recruitment to the small-mesh trawl fishery. © 2015 CSIC.;English;Article;All Open Access, Gold, Green;Scopus;EXCLUDE on study type;Mediterranean - non CS;NA;NA;NA;NA;Simulated dynamics;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Paper described as a broad overview, no actual analysis takes place but the content is relevent to management of fisheries for juvenile fish. ;None;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Binch

In our study, the potential for angling-induced change in fish behavior was examined in two marine coastal fishes exploited by boat recreational fishing in the Mediterranean (Mallorca, Spain). It was expected that the mean vulnerability to capture of surviving individuals would differ across a gradient of previous exposure to recreational angling and that this effect would be present in multiple species. The prediction received partial empirical support. Recreational angling intensity was correlated with enhanced gear-avoidance behavior in only one of the two study species, the carnivorous painted comber (Serranus scriba). By contrast, the omnivorous fish species in our study, the annular seabream (Diplodus annularis), did not differ in its behavior towards hooks in exploited compared with unexploited sites. These results suggest that recreational angling may contribute to patterns of hyperdepletion in catch rates because of increased timidity and associated reduced vulnerability to fishing gear in some exploited species. Such effects would lead to erroneous interpretations about the status of the fish stocks when assessed by fishery-dependent data and would negatively affect catch rates and quality of the fishery in the affected species. © 2015, National Research Council of Canada.

The highest densities of susceptible species occur in temperate and sub-polar regions of both hemispheres, with lower densities in tropical regions. Gillnet fisheries are widespread and particularly prevalent in coastal areas. A review of reported bycatch estimates suggests that at least 400,000 birds die in gillnets each year. The highest bycatch has been reported in the Northwest Pacific, Iceland and the Baltic Sea. Species suffering potentially significant impacts of gillnet mortality include common guillemot (Uria aalge), thick-billed guillemot ( Uria lomvia), red-throated loon ( Gavia stellata), Humboldt penguin (Spheniscus humboldti), Magellanic penguin ( Spheniscus magellanicus), yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes), little penguin (Eudyptula minor), greater scaup (Aythya marila) and long-tailed duck (Clangula hyemalis). Although reports of seabird bycatch in gillnets are relatively numerous, the magnitude of this phenomenon is poorly known for all regions. Further, population modelling to assess effects of gillnet bycatch mortality on seabird populations has rarely been feasible and there is a need for further data to advance development of bycatch mitigation measures. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.;English;Review;NA;Scopus;EXCLUDE on study type;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Systematic review of global literature.

The Alboran Sea is characterized by highly dynamic and variable water masses that make it one of the most productive areas in the oligotrophic Mediterranean Sea. Hydrodynamic features occur across all time and length scales, such as tidal motion, strong baroclinic jets, large-scale gyres, mesoscale eddies, upwelling regions, and frontal zones, all with important implications on the dynamics of plankton and benthic ecosystems [3]. The strong surface inflow of Atlantic water through the Strait of Gibraltar, known as the Atlantic Jet, maintains two semipermanent anticyclonic gyres consisting of a mixture of different proportions of Mediterranean and Atlantic waters that change in sympathy with tidal cycles. The knolls in the Alboran Sea are affected by benthic trawl fisheries, evidenced by trawl marks and lost fishing gear observed in the study area. Overall, the naturalness of the study area is considered to be modified. The topography of the Alboran Basin seafloor is characterized by pinnacles, knolls, banks, ridges, and troughs as a direct expression of the Pliocene-Quaternary compressive tectonic regime.

Untangling the effects of broad-scale anthropogenic stressors is complicated as appropriate unimpacted areas at relevant scales are usually unavailable for contrast with impacted regions. Although the perfect study design in the traditions of small-scale manipulative experiments may not always be possible, many human impacts and the mechanisms associated with ecosystem responses have been highlighted in literature allowing contrasting predictions on expected patterns to be tested. We applied such an approach to the Marine Protected Area of Bergeggi (Ligurian Sea, NW Mediterranean). Our study aimed at assessing the effects of recreational angling (a presumed chronic stress) on the recovery of epibenthic communities following historical date-mussel harvesting (an extreme disturbance) by making and testing alternative predictions on the structure of epibenthic communities that should be apparent depending on the importance of specific mechanisms. Effects of date-mussel harvesting were still visible 20. years after its cessation, mostly because recovery is hampered by persistent sea-urchin grazing. We hypothesized that fish biomass removal by angling favours high sea urchin abundance. Based on these premises, we assembled information on angling pressure, sea urchin abundance and substratum cover by different trophic guilds to test our predictions. Our study indicates that the interaction between date-mussel harvesting and angling produced a shift, from autotrophic-dominated to consumer-dominated communities as a consequence of cascading trophic effects. Such an outcome implies that chronic recreation fishing pressure is blocking recovery in locations previously impacted by date-mussel harvesting. Testing predictions proved efficient in describing the interaction among stressors when system history is known and represents a valuable approach to provide scientifically sound insight for improved conservation management. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.;English;Article;NA;Scopus;NA;Mediterranean - non CS;5,000-10,000;two month;Oct/50;snapshot/no repeat sampling;Visual Analyses of Quadrats/Transects;NA;Two-way ANOVA _ ANOVA;2;2;3;NA;NA;4.4;Fisheries independent survey;Foodweb;NA;NA;NA;Epibenthic communities;Catch_and_bycatch;Target;Fishing Pressure ;None;Recreational;Hooks_and_lines;Angling;NA;Trophic organisation _ Percentage cover;Trophic structure;Multiple;Autotrophic guild cover was significantly different between conditions and among sites.

The main problems of fisheries management are the capture and killing of juvenile and undersized fish and thus restrictions mainly concern mesh size in cod-end. However another recurrent problem and non-negligible is the by-catch of undersize commercial fish and of non-target species. Hence, regulations to reduce such by-catch have formed a part of fisheries management techniques since the early 20th century. As a consequence, successful developments and technical modification have been used to reduce capture of undersized fish and discards (i.e. mesh size, separator panels, and sorting grids) in the last decades. Technical modification concerning reduction of damage and mortality to benthic communities are less documented. Most of the tentative to replace tickler chain, panels or legs by other systems have failed, while results showed a decrease in non-target catch, and a decrease in commercial catch was observed. This paper presents fishing experiments with modified otter trawl aimed at reducing discard rates and direct mortality of benthic infauna and epifauna without affecting the level of landings (i.e. a comparison of environmental effects caused by a conventional otter trawl compared to a modified otter trawl with enlighten experimental legs). Catch composition, by-catch and short-term effects to macro- and megafauna communities of both fishing gear (conventional and modified) were investigated. Results show that no differences for commercial catch biomass or for benthic communities' structure were observed. Moreover, by-catch analysis showed no difference while significant higher damage and direct mortality were observed for target and non-target species caught by the normal otter trawl compared to those caught by the modified one. Consequently, although limited, the severity of the damage appears to be linked with the type of trawl-legs used. The modified otter trawl permits to decrease damage and mortality to captured and non-captured organism and thus to reduce impacts to exploited marine ecosystems. These results are of interest and appear attractive in the framework of marine ecosystems preservation and conservation, as well as of fisheries management. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In all, 27 fishing trips of duration 2-5 weeks each were sampled between 2002 and 2005, covering the North Sea and the western waters of the British Isles. Different methods to estimate discards were compared, and raising these estimates by number of trips or by total landings did not greatly influence the annual estimates of total discards. Some 30 000 t of fish were discarded annually by the fleet, the commercial target species mackerel, herring, and horse mackerel being discarded most, with 41%, 19%, and 15% of the total discards by weight, respectively. The most commonly discarded non-commercial species was boarfish, accounting for 5% of total discards. Slippage accounts for 10% of all discards, and the most common species slipped is herring. There is extensive discarding of juvenile mackerel in the horse mackerel fishery, and to a lesser extent highgrading of mackerel in the same fishery. © 2008 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

A calibrated food web model representing current conditions of the ecosystem and selectivity data from recent fishing experiments were used to perform temporal dynamic simulations. This enabled the evaluation of direct and indirect impacts of fishing and provided insights into the sustainability of various management options for the trawl fishery. This fishery has the biggest fleet in the area, it is highly multispecies, and catches are largely composed of juveniles of target species and non-target species, which are often discarded in large quantities. Simulations indicate that improvement of trawl selectivity would have noticeable and complex direct and indirect effects on target and non-target demersal species. The biomass and catch of various commercial species (e.g. anglerfish, adult hake) would increase, while that of invertebrates (e.g. suprabenthos, Norway lobster) and juvenile and small-sized fish species (e.g. juvenile hake, blue whiting) would decrease due to higher predation mortalities and trophic cascades in the food web. Impacts on the pelagic compartment would also be noticeable. A slight increase in the mean trophic level of the community and of the catch is predicted, as well as of ecosystem biomass diversity. Generally, however, a greater reduction of fishing effort would be necessary for the recovery of highly exploited or overexploited demersal species. Trawling would experience moderate decreases in catches, while long-lining and bait-trolling would benefit. This work highlights the importance of including the mortality incurred during or post-escape from trawl nets when assessing the ecosystem effects of improved trawl selectivity. © Inter-Research 2008.;English;Article;All Open Access, Bronze, Green;Scopus;NA;Mediterranean - non CS;50,000-100,000;quarter;10,000-50,000;snapshot/no repeat sampling;Regular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;Spearman non-parametric correlation coefficient;2;2;3;NA;NA;4.4;Modelling/simulation;Foodweb;NA;NA;NA;Crustacea _ Cephalopods _ Benthic Invertebrates _ Elasmobranchs _ Cnidaria _ Teleosts;Catch_and_bycatch;Target;Selectivity of trawl gear;None;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;NA;South Catalan Sea demersal trawl fishery;Biomass ratios _ Catch composition ;Abundance/biomass/density;Multiple;Scenarios 1 and 2, substantial increases and decreases in biomass of species were observed, while in Scenario 3, changes were minor.

Indices of diversity, richness, evenness, dominance and ABC plots were used to assess spatial structure, seasonal changes and diversity of the demersal fish assemblages. In general, species diversity, richness and evenness decreased with water depth, with the highest values at depths < 100 m. Dominance increased with depth, getting its maximum at depths >200 m. The effect of depth on the diversity patterns observed was always significant, while no seasonal trends were detected.

Meiofauna may be impacted directly or indirectly by this disturbance, since the passage of trawls causes immediate mortality or displacement, changes sediment structure and geochemistry and affects the abundance of predators or competitors. Since meiofauna make a significantly greater contribution to benthic production than the larger macrofauna, there are compelling reasons to assess their response to chronic trawling disturbance. In this study, we determined the effects of trawling disturbance, season, sediment type and depth on the structure and diversity of nematode communities. Our analyses were based on comparisons between nematode communities in three beam-trawl fishing areas in the central North Sea. These areas were trawled with mean frequencies of 1 (low disturbance), 4 (medium) and 6 (high) times year-1 respectively. Our analyses showed that trawling had a significant impact on the composition of nematode assemblages. In two sampling seasons, the number of species, diversity and species richness of the community were significantly lower in the area subject to high levels of trawling disturbance than in the areas subject to low or medium levels of disturbance. However, levels of disturbance at the 'low' and 'medium' sites may have been insufficient to cause marked long-term changes in community structure.

Introduction;1999;Fisheries Research;40;2;103;106;10.1016/S0165-7836(98)00206-9;NA;Traditionally, fisheries scientists were concerned with the effects of fishing on the dynamics of exploited stocks. In recent years, however, interest in the wider effects of fishing on community structure, diversity, ecosystem processes and the abundance of non-target fishes, invertebrates, birds and marine mammals has burgeoned. In this Special Issue of Fisheries Research we present an introduction to effects of fishing on marine ecosystems followed by six related papers that describe patterns in fishing effort, diversity and community structure in northeast Atlantic shelf seas. The papers describe the patchiness of fishing effort in space and time, the relative roles of fishing and biogeography in explaining fish community structure, potential biases when trawl samples are used to determine long-term trends in fish communities and the effects of fishing on the diverse invertebrate assemblages associated with tube worms.;English;Editorial;NA;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Does not investigate the impacts of fishing.

During this period, the Zoological Station in Den Helder (The Netherlands) has collected and registered by-catch species caught by commercial fishermen. The annual numbers of registered specimens were used to estimate the species-specific catch efficiencies of otter and beam trawlers between 1945 and 1983. This analysis was restricted to 7 fishes (sharks, rays, skates) and 10 invertebrate species (whelks, urchins, squids, crabs) all of which have a demersal life style and were regularly delivered throughout the study period. For most species, the observed variations in annual numbers of fish and invertebrates delivered to the Zoological Station appeared to be related to the changes in type of gear and fishing effort. Results from the model suggest that otter trawlers caught relatively more fish than invertebrates, whilst beam trawlers caught proportionally more invertebrate species (i.e. velvet swimming crab, slender spindle shell) that were rarely delivered during periods of greatest otter trawling effort. On average, the catch efficiency of the beam trawl fleet appeared to be 10 times higher than that of the otter trawl fleet.

During this period, the Zoological Station in Den Helder (The Netherlands) has collected and registered by-catch species caught by commercial fishermen. The annual numbers of registered specimens were used to estimate the species-specific catch efficiencies of otter and beam trawlers between 1945 and 1983. This analysis was restricted to 7 fishes (sharks, rays, skates) and 10 invertebrate species (whelks, urchins, squids, crabs) all of which have a demersal life style and were regularly delivered throughout the study period. For most species, the observed variations in annual numbers of fish and invertebrates delivered to the Zoological Station appeared to be related to the changes in type of gear and fishing effort. Results from the model suggest that otter trawlers caught relatively more fish than invertebrates, whilst beam trawlers caught proportionally more invertebrate species (i.e. velvet swimming crab, slender spindle shell) that were rarely delivered during periods of greatest otter trawling effort. On average, the catch efficiency of the beam trawl fleet appeared to be 10 times higher than that of the otter trawl fleet. Furthermore, the trends shown by the model in species delivered suggested that bottom fisheries had a considerable impact on several demersal fish and benthic invertebrates.;English;Conference Paper;All Open Access, Bronze;Scopus;NA;CS - North Sea;>100,000;multidecadal;10,000-50,000;five year;Fisheries Dependent Data;NA;Catch Efficiency model ;2;2;3;NA;NA;None;Modelling/simulation;Benthos;Benthic_epifauna;Other;NA;whelks _ urchins _ crabs;Catch_and_bycatch;Bycatch;Gear change (Otter vs. Beam trawl);None;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;Beam trawl;NA;Catch Efficiency ;Abundance/biomass/density;Negative;According to the model results, the slender spindle shell, velvet swimming crab and dahlia anemone were hardly affected by otter trawling but rapidly declined from 1960 onwards to less than 20% of the original population size at the end of the study period (Fig. 5).

In this colony, Audouin's gull behaves partly as a scavenger following the trawling fleet and exploiting fishing discards Each year, the trawling moratorium affected different breeding stages of the species: in 1992 it overlapped with pre-laying and laying stages while in 1993 it affected most of the chick- rearing stage. We examined differences in laying dates, laying interval, clutch and egg sizes nest desertion during laying, hatching success, hatchling mass and condition growth rates chick survival and breeding success. The moratorium greatly affected egg production in 1992 delaying the start of laying and dramatically decreasing clutch and egg sizes. Intraclutch egg size variation between the 2 years suggests that egg size profiles are outcomes of the interaction between physiological and environmental factors rather than the result of ultimate factors. Nest desertion was much higher in 1992, probably because some females were under a critical body condition threshold and they deserted after laying the first egg. Hatching success also decreased significantly during 1992 probably related to changes in the size and the quality of the eggs. Chick growth and survivorship was higher in 1992, when trawler discards were normally available, than in 1993. Trawler discard availability during chick rearing was more important than egg size in determining chick survival. However, differences were not always significant, since in 1993 the moratorium did not start until the chicks were 1 wk old, and, further, chicks had higher skeletal size and body condition (in order of importance) than in 1992.

In this area ecosystem degradation and overfishing have been increasing bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba) conflict with fishers. Banana Pingers were applied to Spicara maena gillnets, trammel nets, “lampara” nets and hand-operated squid jig lines (“totanara”) in trials conducted from April to September 2017. Dolphin depredation events were greatly reduced in the gillnet (100%) and the “lampara” net (86%), resulting in a strong increase in catch weight (kg) and revenue (€). In the squid hand-jig line trials, severe depredation events (60%) markedly reduced catch and revenue. In the trammel net, catch weight and revenues were not significantly different in the test and control nets. Despite the absence of dolphin damage, the fish species that are part of the dolphin diet were more abundant in the test net. Our findings suggest that pinger effectiveness may be influenced by a variety of factors including dolphin species, season, habitat and fish species distribution. Notably, the discards of trammel nets account for nearly 50% of the catch and include potentially valuable bycatch species, like Sparisoma cretense, which however commands a low price on the local market. We suggest that together pingers and the local sale of non-target species could mitigate the economic loss due to dolphin damage, although this requires appropriate planning.

However, even when using such devices, some small-sized fish enter the codend of the trawl together with the targeted shrimp. Therefore, bycatch reduction remains a problem in some shrimp fisheries. One such fishery is the Northeast Atlantic deep-water shrimp (Pandalus borealis) fishery where it is mandatory to use a Nordmøre grid. In this study, the bycatch reduction efficiencies and patterns for several fish species using the standard Nordmøre grid and an experimental sieve panel were investigated and compared. The effect of combining these devices was also explored. The bycatch reduction patterns differed significantly between the two devices and a more efficient bycatch reduction was obtained by combining them. However, while the loss of commercial-sized shrimp was only between 0 and 2% for the Nordmøre grid, it was between 37 and 56% for the tested sieve panel, making this completely unacceptable for commercial fishing. Therefore, before a sieve panel can be considered as an option for the fishery, other sieve panel designs that have a significantly lower loss of shrimp catches need to be identified. © 2018 Larsen et al.

For all bycatch species included in this study, adding a sieve panel in front ofthe Nordmøre grid improved the release ofjuvenile fish significantly.

The motivation for seals to interact with fishing gear is high. It provides high densities of fish. A successful means of mitigating the conflict is the pontoon trap. Seal visits here have been frequent. Seals have access to most parts of the trap system including the middle chamber, which is an overhead environment. Concerns have been raised about seals possible entanglement in this specific part of the trap. As a means of keeping seals from entering the middle chamber, two different Seal Exclusion Devices (SEDs) were tested. A diamond mesh SED and a square mesh SED, which was rotated 45. The aim was to compare the functionality of the different SEDs with respect to seal deterrent abilities and catch composition. The hypothesis tested were (i) that seals would not be able to enter the middle chamber, (ii) that the catch would increase and (iii) that the SED would deter larger fish from swimming into the middle chamber. Catch data and underwater film were collected. Larger salmons were caught in traps equipped with SEDs. The SEDs did not affect the number of caught fish or the total catch per soak day. © 2018 Calamnius et al.

It was at the square mesh SED. The seal stayed at the SED for a little over 5 minutes. During this period it tore apart the twine in the SED. There were no filmed seal visits in the trap with the diamond mesh SED or in the control trap. In all, seals destroyed three of the four SEDs used during the experiment. Two were with the square mesh (one each in River Indal and Ljusne) and one with the dia- mond mesh (River Indal). A Chi-square test was performed on the number offilmed hours in which a seal had been present in the funnel. There were no significant differences in visits between traps equipped with a SED or the control trap, df= 2, X2 = 1.44, p = 0.49. There was no bycatch ofseals in the middle chamber in any ofthe traps. Unfortunately, two male seals were bycaught in earlier parts ofthe trap. One ofthe seals had become entangled in the leader net near the entrance to one ofthe wings. The other was entangled in the first adapter. Both seals had an estimated weight ofslightly over 100 kg each. There was only one seal visit throughout the entire study. It was therefore not possible to deduct whether the SED had any deterrent effect on seals or not. The seals learning ability and adaptability is one ofthe major challenges when designing new mitigation means or modifying existing fishing gear. Instead, the SEDs were subject to damage by seals on several occasions. The torn SEDs attests to the seals high motivation ofgetting to the catch, suggesting that a change ofmaterial in the mesh is necessary. Applying a SED in the entrance ofthe middle chamber will prevent most seals from entering an overhead environment, thus reducing the number ofseals that are bycaught.;Bluemel

In particular, in the Mediterranean Sea, only few studies are available about bycatch and discards of elasmobranchs in artisanal coastal fisheries. In this study, we focus our attention on elasmobranch catches in a trammel net fishery targeting cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) in the southeastern Ionian coast of Sicily (central Mediterranean Sea). In 2017, during the peak S. officinalis fishing season (February–May), four species of the infraclass Batoidea (Raja radula, Dasyatis pastinaca, Torpedo marmorata and Torpedo torpedo) constituted the total elasmobranch catches of the 16 survey days. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) of T. torpedo, in both number of specimens and biomass terms, showed the highest value, accounting for about 50% of the total. Except for the three larger specimens of R. radula (1.7% of R. radula specimens caught), all elasmobranchs were discarded. An ANOVA showed significant differences (P<0.05) between monthly CPUE values of the four species;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The resulting catch loss engenders hostility from fishers, and interactions between dolphins and nets can result in bycatch mortality. One potential mitigation measure is the placement of marine mammal acoustic deterrent devices, or pingers, on the nets. With the support of local fishermen, Aquamark 210 pingers were deployed on trammel net set for cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) during the spring season (March 2010 to May 2010), when there is more interaction with dolphin. Throughout the period of experimentation, we have used trammel nets equipped with pingers (pinger net) and trammel nets that have played the role of control (control net). During the trial, data on fishing operations were recorded by onboard observers. We analysed two response variables, the presence or absence of evidence that dolphins had interacted with the net and catch per unit effort. The pingers attracted the bottlenose dolphins (T. truncatus) to trammels nets. Overall, pinger nets were more attacked than control nets. Tested pingers also appeared to have affected on fishery target species. The catch per unit effort decreased by 22%. Our results suggest that Aquamark 210 pingers in the artisanal fisheries of Kerkennah islands increase the rate of net interaction, but it was recommended to investigate how bottlenose dolphin (T. truncatus) may interact with other acoustic devices.;English;Article;;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Bluemel

Attempts to use bottom-set pots as an alternative to gillnets and longlines have been unsuccessful, as pots too are affected by large bycatches of crab. In this field study, pots were floated off the bottom in order to avoid crab bycatch. A standard two-chamber groundfish pot was modified by mounting a suspension arrangement that allowed the pot to orient itself with the current about 70 cm above the seabed. Fishing trials were conducted in the Varangerfjord (northern Norway) to compare floated and bottom-set reference pots. Floating the pots off the bottom eliminated king crab catches, while bottom-set pots caught an average of 21 crabs each. Moreover, floated pots caught significantly more cod than bottom-set pots (3.6 and 2.5 cod per pot, respectively), with the majority of the 45% increase being cod below minimum legal size. The catch increase was explained by the fact that the entrance of floated pots always maintained a down-current orientation, whereas in bottom-set pots shifting current directions may lead the odour plume away from the entrance, thereby reducing the rate of entry of cod. Full-scale fishing trials are needed in order to evaluate whether floated pots could become a commercially viable method of catching cod. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The AHDs emitted pulses of 250-500-ms duration, worked at a frequency of 15 kHz, and a source level of 179 dB re 1 µPa rms at 1 m. AHDs were deployed during three consecutive fishing seasons. Catches were significantly higher in traps with AHDs (25.5 kg d-1) than in controls (12.0 kg d-1), and catch damage was less (3.5 vs. 6.7 kg d-1). These results persisted over and between fishing seasons, but late in the season damage to the catches was common also in traps with AHDs. This study shows that the AHD may be a complementary mitigation tool in the seal-fishery conflict in certain types of fisheries, even though it is technically demanding, and for environmental reasons should be used with great care. © 2006 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.;English;Article;All Open Access, Bronze;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Bluemel

Significant differences in the proportions of the different catch components were found between the two Maritime Districts considered. Similarly, the size-frequencies of landed catch were significantly different between Districts. Great variability in overall catch composition from one Zone to another within one District was detected, emphasising the importance of a Zone-based management, rather than a District-based management.

This area was heavily fished for Pecten maximus (Linnaeus, 1758) prior to closure, and the seabed immediately surrounding the closed area is still one of the most heavily dredged in the Irish Sea. Two methods have been used to study the effect of scallop dredging on the benthos in this closed area and adjacent fished areas. Firstly, twice-yearly grab sampling of experimental plots inside and outside the closed area since 1995 has enabled comparisons of the benthic infauna and epifauna of experimentally dredged plots, undredged control plots and plots exposed to commercial dredging. Secondly, divers have carried out visual transect surveys of P. maximus numbers regularly since closure. Communities of experimentally disturbed plots have become less similar to adjacent undisturbed control areas and more similar to commercially dredged areas.

The age structure of the closed area P. maximus population is also different to that outside, with a higher mean age due to the presence of large, old individuals. These result present strong evidence that scallop dredging alters benthic communities and suggest that the closure of areas to commercial dredging may allow the development of more heterogeneous communities and permit the populations of some species to increase.

in species number or diversity; Kruskal–Wallis one- way ANOVA on ranks were performed on various univariate indices calculated from the March 1998 data. No significant differences in total species number or species richness were found between treatments. Diversity (Shannon–Wiener) was slightly higher in the experimentally dredged than the undredged plots; and Pielou’s evenness and Simpson’s Dominancewere both higher in the commercially dredged plots than the experimentally dredged and undredged plots. These rather confusing results suggest that condensing com- plex data with high levels of variability such as these into single indices can mask clear trends in community change shown by multivariate methods. Calculation of the Index of Multivariate Dispersion confirms this; with highest values for the undredged plots; followed by commer- cially and experimentally dredged (Table 1). These results imply that dredging reduces heterogeneity in these communities. As sessile epifaunal species might be considered espe- cially sensitive to dredging disturbance; more detailed multivariate analyses were done on the sessile spe- cies subset of the March 1998 dataset. The pattern of dredged and undredged plots clustering separately; and of dredged plots being more similar to each other; is still seen in these cluster analyses (Fig. 3). The sessile species that contribute most to similarity amongst samples in the dredged plots (experimentally and commercially dredged) are encrusting bryozoans; encrusting sponges and small ascidians. Those that make the undredged samples similar to each other are upright forms; such as the bryozoans Cellaria spp Ellis & Solander; 1786 and Crisidia cornuta (Lin-naeus; 1758); and the hydroids Halecium spp Oken; 1815. It is these differences in morphology that con- tribute most to the dissimilarities between undredged- experimentally dredged and undredged-commercially dredged (Fig. 4;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This paper investigates some aspects of this process, including the relative attractiveness to predators of different discard species, and the role of damage in scavenger attraction. A time-lapse video system with a 1000 m long cable was positioned in an area closed to fishing, adjacent to the most heavily fished scallop (Pecten maximus) ground in the Irish Sea. A variety of undamaged and damaged by-catch animals were positioned in front of the camera, and the subsequent predator aggregations investigated. Densities of scavenger species up to 200 times that of the background population were observed, and aggregations of some species persisted for up to 3 days. The most frequently recorded scavengers, and therefore presumably those species most likely to benefit from discards as a food source, were: Asterias rubens L., Astropecten irregularis (Pennant), Liocarcinus spp Stimpson, Pagurus spp Fabricius and Callionymus lyra L. Predator attraction to apparently undamaged queen scallops, Aequipecten opercalaris (L.), was almost as high as to damaged A. opercularis. Of all the prey species studied, queen scallops were the most attractive to scavengers. A directional relationship was found between the ambient water current and the arrival of the starfish, Asterias rubens.

The prey species vary in attractiveness to scavengers, and there is evidence to suggest that the inclusion of queen scallops, Aequipecten opercularis, in the discards may increase the size of scavenger aggregation. The damage sustained by the by-catch may not be as instrumental in determining attraction of predators as initially assumed. It is apparent that undamaged animals in unnaturally high densities may be sufficient to bring about a scavenger aggregation.;NA;4.4;Field experiment;Benthos;Benthic_epifauna;NA;NA;benthic community;Discarding;NA;before and after baiting, under the different light regimes, or between damaged and undamaged A. opercularis _ before and after baiting with mixed damaged benthos;NA;Commercial;Dredges;NA;scallop;daily mean abundance of species;Abundance/biomass/density;Multiple;Table 4 summary of results from experiements using baits comprising different by-catch species to attract scavengers to a baited video camers.

Moreover, there is probably a different recovery ability between the two communities after the distur- bance. In zone 1, except the 1t0, all other treated sam- ples appear to be near their controls. This shows that the community rapidly begins the recovery process, resulting in an increase in similarity between treated areas and controls (after two months – t3 – the two situations are very close). In zone 2 the group of treated areas, sampled at time t1, t2 and t3, is different from the respective controls. The high similarity between the sample collected in the treated area immediately after the haul and its control shows the presence of a lag-time before the effects of disturbance can be detected. Zone 1: higher average diversity values (Table 1) are found when the t0 sample is involved in the comparison, with a maximum value found when the two time extremes are compared (d = 67.46). In other comparisons the difference is significantly smaller, al- though it never goes to 0: between t2 and t3 samples d = 31.5 (a difference of this order is found in the comparison between the samples collected at t3 in the treated and in control areas). The number ofsignificant species follows the same general pattern. In the t0 vs. t2 comparison the significant species are virtually the same as the t0 vs. t1 one. This also applies to the t0 vs. t3 comparison. Zone 2: the situation is found to be quite differ-ent from the one in the zone 1. The pattern is less clear and, to some extent, inexplicable. The average diversity always tends to be very high (d> 58), but, in spite of it, the species significantly contributing to d are always between 0 and 2, as though all species contribute equally to the overall average diversity.

This information covers aspects such as life span and growth and mortality rates. The sum of samples obtained in the two different seasons allowed the analysis of consistent length frequency distributions and resulted in distinguishing recruits/juveniles from adults of two different ages, i.e. E. cirrhosa is a relatively long living cephalopod, whose reproduction occurs in the second or third year of life. By sampling in different bathymetric strata, different densities on shelf and slope fishing grounds were measured and their displacements with changing season were monitored. The most important stratum in terms of summer densities was in the range 100-200 m depth, which includes the shelf edge, at 150 m. In a relatively narrow strip of seabed, covered by the shelf-edge detritic assemblage and adjacent muddy bottom assemblage VTC (80-150 m), the recruitment of E. cirrhosa occurs from January onwards, while till recent times a specific trawling targeting juveniles used to be carried out in late spring and summer months. In autumn E. cirrhosa is mainly concentrated in shallower waters where trawling activity does not specifically target this species. Trends in numbers and biomass derived by the two series of surveys, and in particular those during autumn series have revealed a significant decrease over the studied time interval. Therefore, the possible relationship between large-scale environmental factors and/or exploitation, was investigated and a positive relationship between summer biomass and winter NAO index was found, even if the cause of such relationship remains unexplained. However, trends of E. cirrhosa landings reported in other studies of the north-western Mediterranean resulted in a similar relationship, thus reinforcing the hypothesis of climatic factors influencing the success of the fishery of this biological resource. A tentative stock assessment, based on relative yield-per-recruit functions, taking into account the two different lengths at first capture and corresponding to mesh sizes of 20 or 40 mm (juveniles and adults nets), showed overexploitation and underexploitation, respectively.

Human exploitation of these resources also varies as a function of space, time and the type of fishing activities performed. These three factors determine fishing strategy at different levels of integration. The purpose of this study was to describe and analyse, with respect to different time scales, the relations between the modalities of resource exploitation and the biological or demographic characteristics of the species involved. These investigations relate to the more general task of acquiring the basic knowledge needed for spatialised management of fishing effort. A fleet of trawlers from La Rochelle, operating in the Bay of Biscay, was studied over a 15-year period (1979-1993), which led to the development of a reference resource exploitation scheme for these vessels. The degree of stability of this scheme over time was determined from landing profiles of the 18 most important species fished (94% of landings). An annual cycle for the species composition of landings was determined by multiple factor analysis. Two factors account for more than 55% of the inertia of the data. The first, of biological origin, is closely related to the breeding activity of species and associated migrations between the coast and the open sea. The second is spatial in nature, corresponding to the distribution and availability of resources according to a bathymetric gradient. This organisational scheme persisted over the first 13 years, but showed signs of change toward the end of the study period. Analysis of multi-year trends indicated four periods marked by sustained levels of landings per unit of effort for some species (decreasing for sole and wedge sole, or increasing for Norway lobster, striped red mullet, rays and the smallspotted catshark). These changes are attributable to restrictions on resource access imposed on the fleet (regulations and/or competition among the fishing gears for occupation of space), variations in the abundance of traditionally fished populations (hake, anglerfish) and changes in the professional behaviour of fishermen. © 2002 Ifremer/CNRS/Inra/IRD/Cemagref/Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

While this might be true of the pelagic fish living in the water column, it is certainly not true of the demersal fish which live on or close to the bottom on the continental slopes around the British Isles (the Atlantic Frontier). These fish are currently being commercially exploited. There is growing evidence to support the view that success of the demersal fish assemblages depends on the pelagic or benthopelagic food sources that impinge both vertically and horizontally onto the slope. There are several quite separate and distinct deep-water fisheries on the Atlantic Frontier. It is a physical barrier, the Wyville-Thomson Ridge, which results in the most significant division of the fisheries. The Ridge, which has a minimum depth of about 500 m, separates the warmer deep Atlantic waters from the much colder Norwegian Sea water and as a result, the deep-water fisheries to the west of the Hebrides and around the offshore banks are quite different from those of the Faroe-Shetland Channel (West of Shetland). The fisheries to the West of the Hebrides can be further divided by the fishing method used into bottom trawl, semipelagic trawl and longline. The bottom-trawl fisheries extend from the shelf-slope break down to about 1700m and the target species varies with depth. The smallest vessels in the fleet fish on the upper slope, where an important target species is the anglerfish or monkfish (Lophius spp.). On the mid-slope the main target species are blue ling (Molva dypterygia) and roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris), with bycatches of black scabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo) and deep-water sharks. On the lower slope orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) is an important target species. The major semipelagic trawl fishery is a seasonal fishery on spawning aggregations of blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou). The other semipelagic fishery is on spawning aggregations of the greater silver smelt or argentine (Argentina silus). Spanish and UK vessels that target mainly hake (Merluccius merluccius) and a Norwegian fleet that targets ling (Molva molva), blue ling and tusk (Brosme brosme) dominate the upper slope longline fishery. West of Shetland, the fishery on the upper slope has some similarities with that of the Hebridean slope, with anglerfish and blue ling being important target species. A quite different fishery occurs in the transition zone between the Atlantic and Norwegian Sea waters. Here the main target species is Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides). Below the transition zone biomass decreases rapidly and there is no fishery. It is generally agreed that many deep-water species have slow growth, a high age at first maturity and a low fecundity, which makes them vulnerable to over-exploitation. Other features of these fishes such as high mortality of discards and escapees will add to the problems. Despite this the only management procedures in place are general limitation of effort measures within the area of jurisdiction of the European Union. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.;English;Article;;Scopus;EXCLUDE on study type;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Bluemel

An alternative yield paradigm for juvenile fisheries, illustrated by the hake Merluccius merluccius fishery in the Mediterranean;1997;Aquatic Living Resources;10;5;257;269;10.1051/alr:1997029;;The paper explores the apparent contradiction between a high trawling pressure on juveniles and sustained production of hake that has occurred over the last decade in many Mediterranean fisheries. The practical consequences are followed of assuming rapid declines in natural mortality rate M in the first few years of life to a low, constant adult natural mortality, as well as the observation, for small-mesh trawl cod ends, of declining availability with age. Several approaches are proposed for fitting declining M-with-age with a reciprocal function for hake, using criteria based on mean life-time fecundity, mean age at egg production, existing estimates of adult M, and vectors based on stock productivity assumptions. All vectors of M-at-age were similar to MSVPA estimates of North Sea stocks. The implications of the changes in mortality with age for stocks harvested by fine-mesh trawls were explored in yield per recruit calculations under 2 different hypotheses: 1) using current estimates of growth and adult mortality, 2) M-at-age vectors for juveniles, dropping rapidly from age 0+, and declining availability to trawling for older fish. These hypotheses were compared within yield per recruit analyses. Under the new assumptions, given current F>>M (adults), yield isopleths predict no significant increases in Y/R with stretched mesh > 40 mm, but a substantial decline in fecundity per recruit with small increases in effort by gill nets or longlines, aimed at mature fish. These results are linked to the refugium concept for older fish, and it is speculated that this may be in part responsible for the continued productivity of other sustained fisheries for juvenile resources elsewhere.;English;Article;;Scopus;EXCLUDE on study type;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;None;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Bluemel
SW4_1833;E4;Oro D.;Effects of trawler discard availability on egg laying and breeding success in the lesser black-backed gull Larus fuscus in the western Mediterranean;1996;Marine Ecology Progress Series;132;01/Mar;43;46;10.3354/meps132043;;The availability of trawler discards is likely to have a pronounced effect on the reproduction of seabirds, but this importance is normally difficult to quantify. A comparison between 2 breeding seasons of the lesser black-backed gull, one of them affected by a trawling moratorium, has allowed an assessment of the effects of discard availability on its egg laying. When trawlers operated, diet was dominated by fish from discards, while during the trawling moratorium gulls fed from refuse tips, olive tree fields and especially rice fields. Although neither breeding phenology was different nor was clutch size significantly lower in the year of the trawling moratorium, the volume of the eggs decreased significantly, showing the importance of trawler discard availability as a proximate determinant of egg production of scavenging seabirds. Since the moratorium overlapped with the chick rearing stages in both years, breeding success was probably lower than before the establishment of the trawling moratorium in 1991. However, the breeding success was higher in 1994 than in 1995, when the moratorium overlapped with the entire period of chick growth. Population dynamics of the species is probably affected by changes in trawler discard availability, especially if a trawling moratorium continues for many years.;English;Article;All Open Access, Bronze;Scopus;NA;Mediterranean - non CS;NA;two year;NA;week;Other;Colony nest monitoring;contingency tables _ G-test statistic _ Mann-Whitney U-test _ ANOVA;2;2;3; When trawlers operated, diet was dominated by fish from discards, while during the trawling moratorium gulls fed from refuse tips, olive tree fields and especially nce flelds.

SW4_1947;E4;Postuma K.H.;On the abundance of mackerel (scomber scombrus l.) in the northern and north-eastern north sea in the period 1959-1969;1972;ICES Journal of Marine Science;34;3;455;465;10.1093/icesjms/34.3.455;;Although fishing intensity on North Sea mackerel during the years 1959-1966 was estimated to be very low as indicated by a low total mortality-rate (Z = 0.28), the abundance of the mackerel as measured by the catch-per-unit-effort in the Dutch trawl- fisheries declined due to a failing recruitment. Recruitment to the North Sea population was poor after the strong year-class 1958 appeared in the trawl-fisheries in 1962. The combined effect of a very moderate fishing intensity and poor recruitment, gave the mackerel population the appearance of an old accumulated stock by the middle sixties. Since the introduction of the purse-seine fishery in 1964 the total international catch of North Sea mackerel started to rise, reaching an unprecedented level of about 900000 tons in 1967. As a result of these substantial catches mortalities rose to an average of Z = 0.80 in the late sixties. In 1968 and 1969 mackerel abundance in the North Sea dropped to a very low level as a consequence of the high fishing intensity and the persisting failure of recruitment to the now decimated stock. Although the yield curve in mackerel does not suggest large gains from protection- measures such as minimum size or effort restriction, the danger of an unlimited fishery on a stock of small sized mackerel are discussed. © 1972 Conseil International pour l’Exploration de la Mer.;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;CS - North Sea;>100,000;multidecadal;Oct/50;subday;Fisheries Dependent Data;NA;None;2;2;1;NA;no stastical tests carried out;None;Fisheries dependent survey;Fish_teleost;Pelagic;NA;NA;mackerel (Scomber scombrus);Catch_and_bycatch;Target;catch _ fishing mortality ;NA;Commercial;NA;NA;North Sea mackerel;CPUE _ percentage at age _ mortality rate;Abundance/biomass/density;Multiple;Abundance: It appears that the CPUE in the late fifties and the beginning of the sixties was higher than during the late sixties and does show a steady decrease over the whole period. Recruitment: the decline in CPUE in weight is certainly partly caused by the failure of recruitment. The 1955 and 1958 year classes recruiting in 1959 and 1962 respectively are the only good year-classes coming to the fishery in the period 1959-1969. No other strong year classes follower to reinforce the stock, except the year class of 1965 which appeared in 1967 as two year olds. this year class however did not reappear in quantity in 1968 and 1969. Mortality: For the period 1959-1969 in the area north-east and the areas north-east and north combined unsmoothed and smoothed mortality estimates are given in Table 6. The mortality rates in the two sets show large fluctuations between —0-31 and 1-32, which are presumably connected with variations in the availability of mackerel. This difficulty can be overcome by taking averages over longer periods. Average instantaneous mortality estimates have been computed for the whole period studied (1959-1969) and for periods before and after the impact of the purse-seine fishery, that is for 1959-1969 and for 1967-1969. The results are summarised in Table 7. Mortality rates in the mackerel stock prior to 1966 seem to have been very low (Z = 0-28) and the mackerel population had the appearance of an old accumulated stock as shown by the age compositions in Table 4. The sudden increase of the total catch in the years 1965-1969 from a level of 100000 tons to 900000 tons had a marked effect on the abundance and the mortality rates. In the last two seasons 1968 and 1969 very low abundances and high mortality rates were recorded. The age compositions have become markedly different from those in the years before 1966.;Bluemel

In addition, trawling, purse seine, longline and troll bait fishing fleets were included. Results showed that the functional groups were organized into four trophic levels with the highest levels corresponding to anglerfish, dolphins, large pelagic fishes and adult hake. The system was dominated by the pelagic fraction, where sardine and anchovy prevailed in terms of fish biomasses and catches. Detritus and detritivorous groups also played key roles in the ecosystem and important coupled pelagic-demersal interactions were described. Considering Odum's theory of ecosystem development, the ecosystem was placed on an intermediate-low developmental stage due, at least partially, to the impact of fishing activity. This highlighted the high intensity of fishing in the ecosystem, in accordance with the general assessment of western Mediterranean marine resources, and fishing fleets were ranked as top predators of the system. The low trophic level of the catch was in line with the long history of exploitation in the area. However, the steady decline of pelagic landings between 1994 and 2003, coupled with a decrease of the pelagic biomass within the system, underlined the low resistance of the system in front of perturbations. This decline was reproduced under Ecosim dynamic simulations combining different scenarios of moderate increase of fishing effort and an environmental forcing affecting the availability of preys to small and medium-sized pelagic fishes under wasp-waist flow control. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The recreational fishery is one of the island's main leisure activities, 5.14% of the population (37 265 people) participating. Enthusiasts tend to be mainly middle class (most anglers own boats moored at marinas), middle-aged males (90% male, mean age 46 ± 2 years). The most popular fishing method is from a boat (62.9%), followed by fishing from shore (32.4%), and spearfishing (3.6%). The mean time spent fishing is 3.86 ± 0.03 h d-1, and more than one type of gear (mean 1.27 ± 0.21) is used simultaneously by a single angler. The frequency of fishing is 4-6 times per month, mainly on holidays and weekends, increasing in summer. The activity has a sizeable impact on the coastal fauna, with diverse catches of at least 1209.25 t year-1 (about 615 000 fishing outings year-1). Thus, the amount of carbon extracted annually is at least 137.34 kg C km-2 year-1, and the recreational fishery removes about 31% of production at trophic level 4. Although these are gross estimates and more detailed study of the effect on trophic level and local production is needed, the values do highlight the pressure the recreational fishery exerts on coastal fish communities. Assuming that this level of exploitation is common to north-shore Mediterranean countries, there may be cause for concern about sustainable exploitation in the recreational fishery, and the effectiveness of current protection measures is discussed. Despite the limitations of the study, recreational fisheries clearly should be taken into account when considering measures for fisheries management.

The recreational fishery is one of the island's main leisure activities, 5.14% of the population (37 265 people) participating. Enthusiasts tend to be mainly middle class (most anglers own boats moored at marinas), middle-aged males (90% male, mean age 46 ± 2 years). The most popular fishing method is from a boat (62.9%), followed by fishing from shore (32.4%), and spearfishing (3.6%). The mean time spent fishing is 3.86 ± 0.03 h d-1, and more than one type of gear (mean 1.27 ± 0.21) is used simultaneously by a single angler. The frequency of fishing is 4-6 times per month, mainly on holidays and weekends, increasing in summer. The activity has a sizeable impact on the coastal fauna, with diverse catches of at least 1209.25 t year-1 (about 615 000 fishing outings year-1). Thus, the amount of carbon extracted annually is at least 137.34 kg C km-2 year-1, and the recreational fishery removes about 31% of production at trophic level 4. Although these are gross estimates and more detailed study of the effect on trophic level and local production is needed, the values do highlight the pressure the recreational fishery exerts on coastal fish communities. Assuming that this level of exploitation is common to north-shore Mediterranean countries, there may be cause for concern about sustainable exploitation in the recreational fishery, and the effectiveness of current protection measures is discussed. Despite the limitations of the study, recreational fisheries clearly should be taken into account when considering measures for fisheries management. Moreover, fishing has considerable social import, and the benefits must be taken into account when investments to protect exploited resources are being contemplated. © 2005 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

In the past, long-term changes in the slope of size spectra of research vessel catches have been related to changes in fishing effort, but such changes may simply reflect the cumulative, direct effects of fishing through selective removal of large individuals. If there is resilience in a fish community towards fishing, we may expect increases in specific components, for instance as a consequence of an associated reduction in predation and/or competition. We show on the basis of three long-term trawl surveys that abundance of small fish (all species) as well as abundance of demersal species with a low maximum length (Lmax) have steadily and significantly increased in absolute numbers over large parts of the North Sea during the last 30 years. Taking average fishing mortality of assessed commercial species as an index of exploitation rate of the fish community, it appears that fishing effort reached its maximum in the mid-1980s and has declined slightly since. If the observed changes in the community are caused by indirect effects of fishing, there must be a considerable delay in response time, because the observed changes generally proceed up to recent years, although both size and Lmax spectra suggest some levelling off, or even recovery in one of the surveys. Indeed, significant correlations between all community metrics and exploitation rate were obtained only if time lags =6 years were introduced. © 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

The rate and magnitude of scavenger and predator aggregation was assessed using three different types of bait, undamaged, lightly damaged and highly damaged individuals of the great scallop Pecten maximus. In each treatment scallops were agitated for 40 minutes in seawater to simulate the dredging process, then subjected to the appropriate damage level before being tethered loosely in front of the video camera. The density of predators and scavengers at undamaged scallops was low and equivalent to recorded periods with no bait. Aggregation of a range of predators and scavengers occurred at damaged bait. During the 24 hour period following baiting there was a trend of increasing magnitude of predator abundance with increasing damage level. However, badly damaged scallops were eaten quickly and lightly damaged scallops attracted a higher overall magnitude of predator abundance over a longer 4 day period. Large scale temporal variability in predator aggregation to simulated discarded biota was examined by comparison of results with those of a previous study, at the same site, 4 years previously. The community of predators and scavengers present at the bait was substantially different during the 2 studies. These changes in scavenger community were only partially related to changes in the mean background density of scavenging species. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Several community metrics have been proposed as indicators to support ecosystem-based fishery management. These metrics should be sensitive to fishing impacts and respond rapidly to management action, so that managers can assess whether changes in the fish community are a desirable or undesirable response to management. It should also be possible to estimate metrics with sufficient precision so that changes in the community can be detected on management time scales of a year to a few years. Here, we test the power of a large-scale annual trawl survey (North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey, IBTS) to detect trends in six community metrics: mean length, mean weight, mean maximum length, mean maximum weight, slope of the biomass size spectrum, and mean trophic level. Our analyses show that the power of the trawl survey to detect trends is generally poor. While community metrics do provide good long-term indicators of changes in fish community structure, they are unlikely to provide an appropriate tool to support short-term management decisions. If fish community metrics are to provide effective support for ecosystem-based management, and management time scales cannot be extended, then the power of many surveys to detect trends in fish community structure will need to be improved by increased replication and standardization.

The effect of marine debris on wildlife, tourism and human health is well documented and there is considerable scientific literature about plastic litter in the sea and over the seabed, mostly highlighting the possible impact on marine mammals and tourism. Dispersal of marine and terrestrial organisms on floating objects has biogeographical and ecological interest. For some species, extension of their geographical range is more likely to be related to transport of mature individuals on floating rafts than to the active or passive dispersal of reproductive propagules. Variability and variety of rafting materials has increased dramatically in recent years and marine litter has been used widely as a raft by 'hitch-hiking' species. This paper reports on the benthic invertebrates living on marine debris transported by wind and surface currents over the western Mediterranean Sea. Plastics accounted for the major item of debris because of poor degradability, however glass, cans, fishing nets and polyurethane containers, were also found. Macro-benthos living on raft material comprised mainly molluscs, polychaetes and bryozoans. Large fish were found commonly below large plastic bags. Estimations of the distances that may be covered by hitch-hiking species and the contribution of rafting to the theoretical dispersal of species is provided.;English;Conference Paper;NA;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4.5;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Brown

In the period 1995-99 observations were carried out on board commercial vessels, collecting data for about 500 trawling hours. Nephrops norvegicus, Parapenaeus longirostris and large specimens of Merluccius merluccius were the targets on the fishing grounds from 300 to 450 m, while Aristaemorpha foliacea, Aristeus antennatus and N. norvegicus were targeted from 450 to 650 m depth. By-catch dominated the biomass caught and it was characterized by a high degree of species richness, as a consequence of the reduced selectivity of the bottom trawl gear. An important fraction of the by-catch was made up of non-target commercial species, these providing an important added value to the landings. There was almost no discarding of target species. Annual average discards were about 20% of the total catch. Discarding of commercial species was mostly due to specimens under commercial size, while discarded non-commercial species included large numbers of small sized species of fishes and crustaceans. The results seem to indicate that this kind of fishery achieves a reasonable compromise between efficiency of resource utilisation and impact on the demersal communities.;English;Article;All Open Access, Bronze;Scopus;NA;Mediterranean - non CS;10,000-50,000;five year;1,000-5,000;quarter;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;Descriptive statistics;2;3;2;NA;NA;None;Fisheries dependent survey;Fish_teleost;NA;NA;NA;Full fish community;Catch_and_bycatch;Non-target;Fishing pressure as desired catch;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;Otter trawl;Cumulative fishing;Catches;Other;Multiple;results obtained seem to indicate a reasonable compromise between efficiency of resource ustilisation and impact on th edemersal communities;Brown

Between 2006 and 2008, the Consorzio Nazionale Interuniversitario per le Scienze del Mare (CoNISMa) coordinated a monitoring programme of cetacean by-catch in Italian pelagic trawlers, funded in compliance with European Regulation 812/2004. Sixteen independent observers monitored a total of 3141 hauls. The observation coverage ranged between 0.9 and 6.3% of the regional fishing effort. Almost all by-catch events were recorded in the northern Adriatic Sea. By-catch rates of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) were 0.0006 and 0.0255 individuals per haul, respectively. Given the low number of observed deaths, reliable estimates of total mortality for these two species were not obtained.

Despite the well-known impact of fisheries on seabird population dynamics [6-10], little is known about how discard availability affects seabird movement patterns. Using scenarios with and without trawling activity, we present evidence that fisheries modify the natural way in which two Mediterranean seabirds explore the seascape to look for resources during the breeding season. Based on satellite tracking data and a mathematical framework to quantify anomalous diffusion phenomena, we show how the interplay between traveling distances and pause periods contributes to the spatial spreading of the seabirds at regional scales (i.e., 10-250 km). When trawlers operate, seabirds show exponentially distributed traveling distances and a strong site fidelity to certain foraging areas, the whole foraging process being subdiffusive. In the absence of trawling activity, the site fidelity increases, but the whole movement pattern appears dominated by rare but very large traveling distances, making foraging a superdiffusive process. Our results demonstrate human involvement on landscape-level behavioral ecology and provide a new ecosystemic approach in the study of fishery-seabird interactions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

To this end, the relationships between two types of natural bait and catch per unit effort (CPUE), yield per unit effort, species composition of the catch, fish size, and hooking injury were evaluated in a mixed-species recreational boat fishery at the Balearic Islands (Western Mediterranean, Spain). Two hundred and twenty experimental angling sessions were conducted with two of the most common natural baits used by local anglers, pieces of a marine worm (Perinereis aibuhitensis) and pieces of shrimp (Penaeus vannamei), baited on a standard J-type hook. The average CPUE of hooks baited with worms was significantly larger than the CPUE of shrimp as bait. However, the average yield per unit effort was similar between both bait types because shrimp selected for significantly larger fish. Between-bait differences in species composition were statistically significant. In addition, the use of shrimp caused a significant decrease in the frequency of deep-hooking. As deep-hooking and associated injuries are related to post-release mortality in most fish species, the use of shrimp likely enhances the survival rates of released fish. We recommend the increased use of shrimp as opposed to worms in mixed-species coastal marine recreational fisheries to reduce the catch of undersized fish and the incidences of deep-hooking. Managing bait type might complement standard harvest regulations and facilitate more sustainable exploitation rates. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The data series now includes over 260 taxa from 173 genera. The most abundant taxa are Heteromastus, Levinsinia and Priospio which between them account for nearly 45% of the individuals recorded while the top 10 ranked taxa between them include almost 70% of the individuals recorded. Both total abundance and genera richness have varied through the 36 year series, particularly during the late 1980searly 1990s but there was no trend and values in the 2000s are similar to those at the start of the series. However, MDS ordination of the entire genera abundance series shows a trend in composition of the macrobenthos through time. There is evidence that the changes in composition were driven by fishing impacts, but also influenced by the trend in climate warming and altered fluxes of phytoplankton to the benthos. Given that the dominant taxa have not changed and the total abundance and richness are similar this implies a turnover and redistribution of individuals across many taxa and raises the possibility of shifts in the ecological functioning of the system. © 2008 Copyright Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;CS - North Sea;>100,000;multidecadal;5,000-10,000;two month;Regular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;SIMPER _ linear regression analyses _ MDS (Multidimensional Scaling);2;2;3;NA;NA;4.3;Fisheries independent survey;Benthos;Benthic_epifauna;Other;Mud;NA;Physical disturbance of the seabed;NA;Fishing intensity;Phytoplankton production _ North Atlantic Oscillation Index _ Sea-surface temperature;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;Otter trawl;Demersl fish;abundance _ benthos composition _ community composition;Community composition;Negative;There is evidence that the changes in composition were driven by fishing impacts, but also influenced by the trend in climate warming and altered fluxes of phytoplankton to the benthos;Carbonara

We use a process-oriented model to explore the extent to which changes in marine resources and the ecosystem were driven by trophic interactions, environmental factors and fishing activities. Fishing effort and fishing mortality are used to drive the model, while observed (absolute and relative) biomasses and catches are compared with the predicted results. A reduction in the sum of the squared deviations of the observed and predicted values of the biomass is used as a metric for calibrating and assessing the fit of the model. A posteriori trophodynamic indicators are used to explore the ecosystem's structural and functional changes from 1978 to 2003, and a generalized least squares regression is used to assess the significance of the predicted trends. In general, a high proportion of the variability in the time series data is explained by the main trophic interactions (37-53%), fishing activities (14%), and indirectly by considering the environment (6-16%), as driving factors. The model's predictions match satisfactorily with the yearly data on the biomass for anglerfish, adult hake, demersal sharks, anchovy and mackerel, which show a statistically significant decrease over time, while the biomass of flatfish and seabirds are observed to increase. Catch data show a significant decrease in anglerfish, demersal sharks, anchovy and sardine, while there is an increase in red mullet, flatfish, juvenile hake and horse mackerel. These changes in biomass are predicted to have direct and indirect impacts on the ecosystem mediated by the trophic web, such as the proliferation of non-commercial species with lower trophic levels (e.g., benthic invertebrates) or higher turnover rates (e.g., cephalopods and benthopelagic fish). This is consistent with anecdotal information from the Mediterranean and is likely caused by trophic cascades due to the removal of demersal and pelagic higher trophic level organisms (predator release), and a decrease in small pelagic fish (competitor release). Trophodynamic indicators suggest a degradation pattern over time: both the mean trophic level of the community (mTLco, excluding primary producers and detritus) and a modified version of Kempton's index of biodiversity decrease with time, while the total flow to detritus and the loss of production due to fishing increase from 1978 to 2003.

Despite a UN moratorium on their use in the high seas and a ban in the Mediterranean by all European Union countries, including Italy (EC Reg. 1239/98), some fisheries continue to operate illegally. In 2002 and 2003 three line-transect surveys were conducted in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea around the Aeolian archipelago. These transects were designed to assess the presence, distribution and population size of cetacean species likely to be affected by accidental captures in this area. Data were only sufficient to estimate abundance for the striped dolphin. The best estimate (and first such estimate for this area) was 4030 individuals (CV=0.30, 95% CI=2239-7253) for May 2003. A rough estimate of striped dolphin by-catch, based on floating carcases, was calculated as 36 by-caught animals over a period of 12 days (CV=0.58, 95% CI=11-113).

The aim of this study is to show that population modelling can be developed for this stock and that model estimates are useful to address practical issues such as diagnostics of fishing pressure and interactions between fishing fleets. Abundance indices were calculated from catch and effort data using a General Linear Model and stock size was assessed with analytical methods based on biological data collected since 1996. Cohort analysis was carried out on six cuttlefish cohorts on a monthly basis using catch-at-age data and the results were integrated in a Thomson and Bell model to simulate production and biomass of the stock. GLM indices indicated a strong seasonal pattern of abundance with a peak of adult abundance in spring and of juveniles in autumn. Cohort analysis estimates show that recruitment can vary by a factor of 2 between years. Estimated fishing mortalities indicate rather stable exploitation patterns. Diagnostics show that each studied cohort was generally fully exploited, and do not reveal evidence of recruitment over-fishing. Simulations of fishing fleet interactions for the resource show that otter trawls play a dominant role in cohort exploitation whereas artisanal trap net fisheries are described as ""dependent"" on other gears. In spite of biological differences between teleost fishes and cephalopods, classical age-based models can be adapted to cuttlefish to provide fishery management advice. Although marked over-fishing was not observed, the studied cohorts were subjected to high catch rates and there is little scope for increased exploitation. Interactions between the fishing fleets involved underline the point that management in the coastal zone alone is not sufficient to ensure sustainable exploitation in a migrating species. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Long-term data for non-target species and those living deeper than the fishing grounds are particularly rare. We analysed a unique dataset of scientific trawls made from 1977 to 1989 and from 1997 to 2002, at depths from 800 to 4800 m. Over this time, overall fish abundance fell significantly at all depths from 800 to 2500 m, considerably deeper than the maximum depth of commercial fishing (approx. 1600 m). Changes in abundance were significantly larger in species whose ranges fell at least partly within fished depths and did not appear to be consistent with any natural factors such as changes in fluxes from the surface or the abundance of potential prey. If the observed decreases in abundance are due to fishing, then its effects nowextend into the lower bathyal zone, resulting in declines in areas that have been previously thought to be unaffected. A possible mechanism is impacts on the shallow parts of the ranges of fish species, resulting in declines in abundance in the lower parts of their ranges.

This situation is unprecedented for the marine biosphere and it is essential to understand the mechanisms and pathways by which ecosystems respond. We report that climate change and overfishing are likely to be responsible for a rapid restructuring of a highly productive marine ecosystem with effects throughout the pelagos and the benthos. In the mid-1980s, climate change, consequent modifications in the North Sea plankton, and fishing, all reduced North Sea cod recruitment. In this region, production of many benthic species respond positively and immediately to temperature. Analysis of a long-term, spatially extensive biological (plankton and cod) and physical (sea surface temperature) dataset suggests that synchronous changes in cod numbers and sea temperature have established an extensive trophic cascade favoring lower trophic level groups over economic fisheries.

The ""plaice box"", a gear restriction area in the North Sea that was established to reduce the bycatch of undersized plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), is considered ineffective because there has been a shift in the distribution of juvenile plaice to the waters that remained open to bottom trawlers. Here we examine the hypothesis that bottom trawling benefits the small benthic invertebrates that form the food source for plaice and that the plaice box had a negative impact on food production for plaice. A size-based model of benthic communities indicates that the production of prey was low without trawling and maximal in areas that are trawled once to twice a year. Therefore, bottom disturbance may improve the feeding conditions for species that feed on small invertebrates. As plaice aggregate at the locations with the highest benthic biomass, this may explain the observed redistribution to areas outside the plaice box. We conclude that the plaice box may not have been the most appropriate measure to protect plaice from discarding and that the species' ecology should be considered when choosing the most appropriate management measure to achieve an objective. © 2008 NRC.";English;Article;;Scopus;NA;CS - North Sea;>100,000;month;50,000-100,000;snapshot/no repeat sampling;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;size-based model _ statistics not specified!

Seasonal variation in air temperature severely enhances physiological stress and mortality of species subjected to sorting operations and discarded during annual fishing activities;2008;Hydrobiologia;606;1;195;202;10.1007/s10750-008-9336-x;;Several studies have considered the direct and indirect effects of demersal trawling on discarded species in terms of sublethal damages, survival, and stress due to the fishing processes. Nevertheless the effects of air temperature on the physiological stress and the survival of species during sorting operations were only marginally explored. This factor could be particularly important in the context of sustainable fisheries at temperate latitudes where the seasonal variation of air temperature can be particularly pronounced. In this study the seasonal effects of rapido trawling on the non-target species Liocarcinus depurator (Portunidae) in the Northern Adriatic Sea (Mediterranean Sea) have been compared by applying survival tests and considering the unbalance in metabolites' concentration as indicators of physiological stress. Results showed consistently higher mortalities during exposure to air in summer (temperature: 28°C), which reached about 96% in 20 min, compared to winter (temperature: 9°C) when only 2% of individuals died. Furthermore trawled and emersed crabs showed significant increase of hemolymph ammonia, lactate, and glucose concentrations as effects of extreme exercise and suffocation, which was more prominent during summer, suggesting that air temperature can play an important role in determining non-target species survival. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.;English;Conference Paper;All Open Access, Green;Scopus;NA;CS - Mediterranean;>100,000;year;5,000-10,000;year;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;Mann-Whitney U-test;2;2;3;NA;NA;None;Field experiment;Benthos;Benthic_epifauna;NA;Unknown;Liocarcinus depurator;Catch_and_bycatch;Non-target;catch;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;Beam trawl;NA;survival rates;Mortality;Multiple;The short-term analyses of mortality rates highlighted the presence of a strong seasonal effect. Obtained results reaveal a pronounced sensitivity of this species to mechanical stress of trawling action and to emersion during the sorting process. The integration of the survival tests with the physiological evaluation of the stress, occurring during trawling and sorting operations, suggests that a decline of L. depurator populations should be expected. However, data from surveys show a rather stable situation for the Northern Adriatic Sea.;

The assemblages from two locations of the Balearic Islands situated 120 km apart were compared using data collected seasonally on a bathymetric stratum covering the 150-750 m depth range during six bottom-trawl surveys. The assemblage structure, in terms of species composition, species dominance and population sizes, was differentially affected by the spatio-temporal variables analysed (depth, location and fishing period). Although depth was the main factor determining the assemblage composition, the differences obtained between the two locations were also relevant. On the upper slope these between-location differences in the dynamics of megafaunal assemblages were found to be related to the effect of fishing exploitation. Population size-based metrics and biomass spectra were good predictors of meso-scale fishing effects, and were mainly reflected by elasmobranchs and demersal teleosts. Nevertheless, the effects of fishing depended on the species considered. Two dominant large-sized fish species found on the upper slope in both localities, Galeus melastomus and Phycis blennoides, had higher biomass values associated with lower fishing effort. Although the mean body weight (MBW) of both species and also the mean maximum body weight (MMBW) of G. melastomus agreed with this pattern, the P. blennoides MMBW did not. This last case could be indicative of natural size-trends such as the bigger-deeper phenomenon which refers to the displacement of large individuals towards the deeper limit of their bathymetric distribution, beyond the maximum depth sampled in this study for this species. By contrast, the target species of the upper slope fishery, the red shrimp Aristeus antennatus, was not negatively affected by the direct impact of fishing activity and other environmental factors, such as the presence of specific water masses could also be important. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We used a coupled physical-ecological model (the European Regional Seas Ecosystem Model (ERSEM) with the General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM)) to investigate the impact of demersal trawling on the benthic and pelagic ecosystems of generic stratified and unstratified water columns in the central North Sea. Perturbation experiments were used to simulate trawling events using estimates of mortality of benthic fauna caused by different fishing gears in different habitats, derived from a meta-analysis of over 100 trawling disturbance experiments reported in the literature. The results suggest that the biogeochemical impact of demersal trawling is most significant in regions where gear type, trawl frequency and bed type cause high levels of filter feeder mortality. This results in substantially increased oxygen content of the benthic system and significant changes in its biogeochemistry (increased phosphorus absorption, increased nitrification of ammonia, reduced silicate cycling). The impacts of these changes on the overlying pelagic ecosystem are, however, buffered by the physical environment and the ability of phytoplankton to vary their internal cell nutrient contents. Analysis of recovery of the benthic system on complete cessation of demersal trawling suggests that the system will return to its original state within 5 yr, except in extreme cases where the deposit or filter feeder function is effectively removed, when a permanent change in the function of the benthic ecosystem may result. © Inter-Research 2007.;English;Article;All Open Access, Bronze;Scopus;NA;CS - North Sea;>100,000;two year;NA;NA;Simulated dynamics;NA;ERSEM _ PCA;2;2;3;NA;NA;4.3 _ 4.4;Modelling/simulation;Foodweb;NA;NA;NA;NA;Physical disturbance of the seabed;NA;trawling frequency;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;NA;NA;biomass ;Abundance/biomass/density;Multiple;The results suggest that the biogeochemical impact of demersal trawling is most significant in regions where gear type, trawl frequency and bed type cause high levels of filter feeder mortality.;Festjens

The pressure indicator measures the proportion of the area where trawling frequency is sufficiently high to prevent reaching predicted B0.9 or P0.9. Time to recovery to B0.9 and P0.9 after trawling, depending on the habitat, was estimated using a validated size-based model of the benthic community.

We develop linked state and pressure indicators that show the impact of bottom-trawling on benthic communities. The state indicator measures the proportion of an area where benthic invertebrate biomass (B) or production (P) is more than 90% of pristine benthic biomass (B 0.9) or production (P0.9). The pressure indicator measures the proportion of the area where trawling frequency is sufficiently high to prevent reaching predicted B0.9 or P0.9. Time to recovery to B0.9 and P0.9 after trawling, depending on the habitat, was estimated using a validated size-based model of the benthic community. Based on trawling intensity in 2003, 53.5% of the southern North Sea was trawled too frequently for biomass to reach B0.9, and 27.1% was trawled too frequently for production to reach P0.9. As a result of bottom-trawling in 2003, in 56% of the southern North Sea benthic biomass was below B0.9, whereas in 27% of the southern North Sea benthic production was below P0.9. Modeled recovery times were comparable to literature estimates (2.5 to more than 6 years). The advantages of using the area with an ecological impact of trawling as a pressure indicator are that it is conceptually easy to understand, it responds quickly to changes in management action, it can be implemented at a relevant scale for fisheries management, and the necessary effort distribution data are centrally collected.

Fishing with demersal gears was banned in 1995, but the Gulf was reopened in 1998 only for scallop dredging using the ""lagamna"" gear. Two series of samplings were done with this gear in 1998 and 1999 (October) before the beginning of scallop-fishing period (from November up to March), aiming to investigate possible changes in sponge assemblages. Sponges (Porifera) were the most abundant mesomegafaunal benthic organisms in the Gulf, besides scallops and other bivalves. Total abundance, number of species, species diversity, species richness and evenness of sponge assemblages reduced significantly from the year 1998 to 1999. The population of the excavating Cliona celata, the only infaunal sponge species found in the Gulf, decreased. Multivariate analysis on the abundance data of epibenthic sponge species revealed a clear separation of samples collected during the 2 years, indicating changes in the structure of sponge assemblages. The distinguishing species included a variety of growth forms: massive (Mycale massa, Suberites domuncula and Tethya citrina), lobose (Suberites massa, Tedania anhelans and Halichondria panicea), erect branching (Raspailia viminalis), encrusting (Crambe crambe) and cushion-shaped (Mycale contarenii and Chondrilla nuculla) sponges. Among these species, only S. massa increased its abundance in 1999. All others decreased. No significant loss of information occurred when multivariate analysis was applied to abundance data of genera or families. This comparative study demonstrated that the time interval between two consecutive scallop-fishing periods was insufficient for the recovery of sponge assemblages. It is concluded that scallop dredging causes long-term changes in the structure and biodiversity of sponge assemblages in the Gulf of Kalloni.

Fishing with demersal gears was banned in 1995, but the Gulf was reopened in 1998 only for scallop dredging using the ""lagamna"" gear. Two series of samplings were done with this gear in 1998 and 1999 (October) before the beginning of scallop-fishing period (from November up to March), aiming to investigate possible changes in sponge assemblages. Sponges (Porifera) were the most abundant mesomegafaunal benthic organisms in the Gulf, besides scallops and other bivalves. Total abundance, number of species, species diversity, species richness and evenness of sponge assemblages reduced significantly from the year 1998 to 1999. The population of the excavating Cliona celata, the only infaunal sponge species found in the Gulf, decreased. Multivariate analysis on the abundance data of epibenthic sponge species revealed a clear separation of samples collected during the 2 years, indicating changes in the structure of sponge assemblages. The distinguishing species included a variety of growth forms: massive (Mycale massa, Suberites domuncula and Tethya citrina), lobose (Suberites massa, Tedania anhelans and Halichondria panicea), erect branching (Raspailia viminalis), encrusting (Crambe crambe) and cushion-shaped (Mycale contarenii and Chondrilla nuculla) sponges. Among these species, only S. massa increased its abundance in 1999. All others decreased. No significant loss of information occurred when multivariate analysis was applied to abundance data of genera or families. This comparative study demonstrated that the time interval between two consecutive scallop-fishing periods was insufficient for the recovery of sponge assemblages. It is concluded that scallop dredging causes long-term changes in the structure and biodiversity of sponge assemblages in the Gulf of Kalloni.

The biology of this shearwater is poorly understood, and its study is important to design conservation strategies. We studied the feeding ecology of the Balearic shearwater at sea in the western Mediterranean (1996 to 2000), focusing on the importance of fisheries discards for this species. Fieldwork was conducted on board commercial bottom trawlers (demersal fishery with diurnal activity) and purse seiners (pelagic fishery with nocturnal activity), as well as during experimental trawling surveys. The shearwaters made extensive use of discards, mostly those from trawlers. This was especially so during the late breeding season, which could be related to the general impoverishment of Mediterranean surface waters. At this time of year, most birds foraged along the eastern Iberian coast, with the largest concentrations occurring off the Ebro Delta. This distribution seems determined by favourable local hydrographic conditions and by the presence of important trawling fleets. Balearic shearwaters captured discards by diving at some distance behind fishing vessels, thus reducing interactions with other seabirds. A bioenergetic model estimated that 40.8% of the energy obtained by the Balearic shearwater population comes from trawler discards during the breeding season (March to June), although this value was subject to strong variability (±36.2% SD). In addition to the capture of discards (38% of the feeding instances observed), Balearic shearwaters also obtained food by capturing fish under floating drifting objects (33%), associating with sub-surface predators (10%), capturing small shoaling fish (10%), and feeding upon plankton (10%). The latter behaviour was observed in crepuscular hours, but the shearwaters did not appear to feed at night. In winter, Balearic shearwaters attended fishing vessels to a lesser extent. Upcoming fishing policies could affect Balearic shearwaters in the short term through reduction of discards, although good design of management strategies (such as trawling moratoria) could help to reduce their negative effects.;English;Article;All Open Access, Bronze;Scopus;NA;Mediterranean - non CS;>100,000;two year;1,000-5,000;month;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;Bioenergetic model for Balearic shearwaters _ ANOVA;2;2;3;NA;NA;4.4;Field experiment;Seabirds;NA;NA;NA;Puffinus mauretanicus;Discarding;NA;amount of discards;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;NA;NA;feeding on discards;Other;Positive;Given the importance of discards for Balearic shearwaters, they would probably be affected by a reduction in discards;Festjens

That this species is affected by beamtrawl fisheries is illustrated by the high incidence of damage found on shells, from heavily fished areas. Between 80 and 90% of the damage was found at the posterior ventral side of the shell. This can be explained by the orientation of the living animal in the upper sediment layer and the horizontal movement of the tickler chains on the bottom. Scars on the external shell surface were dated by internal growth lines, revealing that the sampling site had been disturbed at least once a year since 1974. The observed trends in the occurrence of scars per year show a striking coincidence with the increase in capacity of the Dutch fishing fleet over the period 1972-1991. © 1994 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;CS - North Sea;>100,000;half year;NA;snapshot/no repeat sampling;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;not mentioned;2;2;3;NA;NA;4.3;Fisheries independent survey;Benthos;Benthic_epifauna;NA;Unknown;Arctica islandica;Physical disturbance of the seabed;NA;abrasion;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;Beam trawl;NA;scars on shells;Other;Negative;High incidence of damage found on shells from heavily fished areas.

An attempt was made to correlate these changes with environmental factors such as the density of the sole stock, temperature in the growth-season, eutrophication, and fishing effort. Of these factors significant correlations were only found with fishing effort and with indices of the disturbance of bottom layers by active gears. Additional evidence points to the possibility that the amount of beam-trawling with chains has a positive effect on the growth rate and on other biological parameters of the sole. © 1976 Conseil International pour l'Exploration de la Mer.;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;CS - North Sea;>100,000;multidecadal;NA;NA;Other;market sampling;Petersen method;2;2;2;NA;NA;None;Fisheries independent survey;Fish_teleost;Flatfish;NA;NA;Solea solea;Physical disturbance of the seabed;NA;fishing hours;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;Beam trawl;NA;variations in length-at-age;Size/age structure;Positive;A significant correlation was found for condition factors, L8 for females, W8 for both sexes, and the coefficient of anabolism for females with the number of beam trawl fishing hours and with the index of bottom disturbance - the number of equivalent ottertrawl fishing hours. Additional evidence on distribution of fishing effort by beam trawlers points to the possibility that the amount of bottom disturbance by heavy chained beam trawls may have a positive effect on growth in soles. Food organisms are injured by the gear and made more easily available for soles, which may economize on energy for searching, locating and digging out food and may thus transform more energy into growth.;Festjens

We summarize catch data on 20 species and species groups of fishes and lamprey, as well as available abiotic data (salinity, temperature and water transparency). Water transparency gradually decreased during the 20th century being inseparable from a number of non-quantified anthropogenic factors, thus it can be used as an integral index of anthropogenic loading on the ecosystem. Because fisheries statistics were not published regularly, catch data were extracted from archives and various publications. Fishing locations, gear and target species changed over time in relation to each other, reflecting technological developments in fisheries, commercial demands for fishery products and the abundance of fish populations. Until the 18–19th centuries, fisheries took place mostly in rivers where weirs and set nets targeted sturgeon, salmon and whitefish. By the end of the 19th century, herring and smelt were the main targets of fixed nets in coastal areas. A century later, the main commercial species, herring, was harvested with pelagic trawls operating offshore in the Gulf. This evolution in fisheries, along with other anthropogenic activities, caused severe declines in diadromous species. Spawning migrations that make them easy to catch, and their high market value, make diadromous fish more vulnerable than other groups. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that catches of most diadromous species decreased with increasing transparency, which may reflect their response to anthropogenic pressure. Marine and freshwater fish suffered from anthropogenic pressure, but to a lesser extent probably because of a wider distribution and dispersal, and more capital-intensive fishing methods. Catches of marine species, except herring, significantly increased in the 1970–1980s when salinity was comparatively high. We found no correlation of fish catches with temperature. © 2014, Springer Basel.;English;Article;;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;None;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;garcia

The Baltic Sea comprises a heterogeneous oceanographic environment that structures the spatial and temporal distribution of the dominant species cod, herring, and sprat (Sprattus sprattus). Despite local differences, the stocks are traditionally managed as homogeneous units. Here, we present a metacommunity-perspective on source-sink dynamics of Baltic Sea fish stocks by using a spatially disaggregated statistical food web model. The model is fitted to area-specific time series of multiple abiotic and biotic variables using state-space methods. Our analysis reveals pronounced net fluxes between areas, indicative of source-sink dynamics, as well as area-specific differences in species interactions (i.e., density dependence, competition, and predator-prey) and the degree of fishing and climate impact on survival and recruitment. Furthermore, model simulations show that decreasing exploitation pressure in the source area for cod (without reallocating fishing effort) produces an increase in neighboring sink habitats, but a decline of prey species in response to increased predation.

This study focuses on the flanks of La Fonera (or Palamós) submarine canyon in the Northwestern Mediterranean, where an intensive bottom trawl fishery has been active during several decades in the 400-800 m depth range. To explore the degree of alteration of surface sediments (0-50 cm depth) caused by this industrial activity, fishing grounds and control (untrawled) sites were sampled along the canyon flanks with an interface multicorer. Sediment cores were analyzed to obtain vertical profiles of sediment grain-size, dry bulk density, organic carbon content and concentration of the radionuclide 210Pb. At control sites, surface sediments presented sedimentological characteristics typical of slope depositional systems, including a topmost unit of unconsolidated and bioturbated material overlying sediments progressively compacted with depth, with consistently high 210Pb inventories and exponential decaying profiles of 210Pb concentrations. Sediment accumulation rates at these untrawled sites ranged from 0.3 to 1.0 cm y -1. Sediment properties at most trawled sites departed from control sites and the sampled cores were characterized by denser sediments with lower 210Pb surface concentrations and inventories that indicate widespread erosion of recent sediments caused by trawling gears. Other alterations of the physical sediment properties, including thorough mixing or grain-size sorting, as well as organic carbon impoverishment, were also visible at trawled sites.

Sediment properties at most trawled sites departed from control sites and the sampled cores were characterized by denser sediments with lower 210Pb surface concentrations and inventories that indicate widespread erosion of recent sediments caused by trawling gears. Other alterations of the physical sediment properties, including thorough mixing or grain-size sorting, as well as organic carbon impoverishment, were also visible at trawled sites. This work contributes to the growing realization of the capacity of bottom trawling to alter the physical properties of surface sediments and affect the seafloor integrity over large spatial scales of the deep-sea. © 2014 Martín et al.;English;Article;All Open Access, Gold, Green;Scopus;NA;Mediterranean - non CS;50-100;half year;05/Oct;half year;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;descriptive analysis and PCA;2;2;3;NA;NA;4.3;Field experiment;Physical_habitats;Mud;NA;NA;NA;Physical disturbance of the seabed;NA;trawling fishing effort;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;NA;NA;sedimend grain size;Community composition;Positive;medium;garcia

This study focuses on the flanks of La Fonera (or Palamós) submarine canyon in the Northwestern Mediterranean, where an intensive bottom trawl fishery has been active during several decades in the 400-800 m depth range. To explore the degree of alteration of surface sediments (0-50 cm depth) caused by this industrial activity, fishing grounds and control (untrawled) sites were sampled along the canyon flanks with an interface multicorer. Sediment cores were analyzed to obtain vertical profiles of sediment grain-size, dry bulk density, organic carbon content and concentration of the radionuclide 210Pb. At control sites, surface sediments presented sedimentological characteristics typical of slope depositional systems, including a topmost unit of unconsolidated and bioturbated material overlying sediments progressively compacted with depth, with consistently high 210Pb inventories and exponential decaying profiles of 210Pb concentrations.

The monitoring was carried out for 14 months covering periods of different trawling intensities and a close season for the trawling fleet. The seabed morphology was studied by side-scan sonar and sediment texture and organic carbon content were analysed. Suspended sediment vertical distribution was recorded by CTD+turbidity hydrographic profiles and sediment transport was computed using time series from moored turbidimeters and current meters. The results show that the seabed of the fishing ground is strongly affected by scraping and ploughing induced by bottom trawling. Part of the finer fraction of the prodeltaic mud resuspended by trawling is winnowed, increasing the silt content of the settling sediment and also near-bottom turbidity. Sediment resuspended by trawling is incorporated in the bottom nepheloid layer and transported across- and along-shelf, increasing sediment fluxes. Trawling also induces an increase in the organic carbon content in the bottom sediment. All these effects induced by trawling have occurred during the last few decades, changing natural conditions in the fishing ground. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;Mediterranean - non CS;100-500;year;05/Oct;month;Active Acoustic Sampling Survey;NA;Descriptive analysis;2;2;3;NA;NA;4.3;Field experiment;Physical_habitats;Mud;NA;Mud;NA;Physical disturbance of the seabed;NA;trawling fishing effort;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;NA;NA;seabed morphology;Other;Negative;strong;garcia

The monitoring was carried out for 14 months covering periods of different trawling intensities and a close season for the trawling fleet. The seabed morphology was studied by side-scan sonar and sediment texture and organic carbon content were analysed. Suspended sediment vertical distribution was recorded by CTD+turbidity hydrographic profiles and sediment transport was computed using time series from moored turbidimeters and current meters. The results show that the seabed of the fishing ground is strongly affected by scraping and ploughing induced by bottom trawling.

Forty-three percent of a subsample of 1000 pots contained snow crabs, with an average of three crabs per pot. Most of the crabs were alive (~98%) and dominated by large males. Pinch injuries and limb loss were common and tended to decline with increasing crab size. Reflex testing showed that the crabs were vital (i.e. the crabs moved their legs, chelipeds and maxillipeds when stimulated), which was supported by a relatively high meat content. However, energy reserves in the digestive glands (hepatopancreas reserves) were low, indicating overall energy deficiencies. Our results indicate considerable unaccounted mortality due to self-baiting, continued catch and cannibalism. The findings demonstrate that snow crab pots which are lost or abandoned in the Barents Sea fishery maintain huge potential for ghost-fishing impacts. © 2021 The Authors;English;Article;All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green;Scopus;NA;Barents Sea;50,000-100,000;two week;0-5;snapshot/no repeat sampling;Other;fishing gear retrieval cruise using grapnel gear;CPUE;2;2;3;Our results indicate considerable unaccounted mortality due to self-baiting, continued catch and cannibalism.;relationship between fishing pressure and number of ghost gear is not explored however give an insight on the catchability of ghost gear;4.5;Fisheries dependent survey;Benthos;Benthic_epifauna;Other;NA;Chionoecetes opilio;Input of litter;NA;number of individual per ghost net_ number of ghost net;NA;Commercial;Pots;NA;Chionoecetes opilio;ghost gear CPUE;Mortality;Negative;high potential for crab pot ghost fishing;Girardin

Changes were assessed at different spatial and temporal scales using a macrobenthic dataset based on 38 stations sampled in 1987 and 2019, coupled with data from one station sampled annually between 2005 and 2019 as part of the European Water Framework Directive monitoring programme. Taxonomic trajectories indicated 1) changes in the structure and distribution of benthic assemblages, 2) an homogenization of the assemblages, and 3) significant functional shifts. Fishing activities and nutrient enrichment are probably strong drivers of the observed changes, as suggested by the higher mortality rate of fragile, flexible, tubiculous and burrowing species, and the increase in the abundance of opportunistic species in the assemblages. Certain populations of macroinvertebrates seem jointly controlled by climate change and by the aforementioned local factors of disturbance. The Community Trajectory Analysis framework appears as a new and interesting method to track ecological changes in marine ecosystems by measuring change with respect to a baseline state, to help define ecological recovery (station returning to the initial ecological state) and departure (station presenting increased changes over time), and to analyse trajectory similarity. According to the degradation of habitat over time, we identify the need for the implementation of knowledge-based conservation strategies, especially within Natura 2000 sites. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.;English;Article;;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;fishing impact not explored, only discussed in the discussion section to try to explain their finding in community changes;4.3;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Girardin

In the last two decades, many new living scleractinian CWC sites throughout the Mediterranean Basin have been recorded and their distribution has been updated. In the summer of 2018, new scleractinian CWC assemblages were discovered by means of remotely operated vehicle (ROV) and multibeam echosounder (MBES) surveys on the Aceste–Tiberio seamount and Marettimo bank in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea, at depths ranging from 240 to 310 m. In the explored areas, megabenthic communities were dominated by habitat-forming species, some of which have never been reported before on these submarine structures. Healthy patches of Madrepora oculata and Desmophyllum pertusum, together with the solitary coral D. dianthus, were found on rocky pinnacles between inclined silted bottoms, as well as on a wreck. Deep-water fishing activities, mainly longline fishing, negatively affected these communities, particularly coral species. The discovery of these new sites adds new knowledge about the distribution of scleractinian CWCs in the Mediterranean Sea. Moreover, the documented negative effect of fishing activities on CWC species further stresses the need for urgent and specific conservation measures. In this regard, the co-occurrence of several long-lived, slow-growing, and vulnerable species on these seamounts and banks supports the establishment of specific marine protected areas [i.e., offshore Natura 2000 sites, in accordance with the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) - Habitat 1170 - Reefs]. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;Mediterranean - non CS;50,000-100,000;month;100-500;subday;Visual Analyses of Quadrats/Transects;NA;occurrence _ abundance;1;2;2;The most important anthropogenic impact on the benthic community;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The GoA differs from neighboring ecosystems of the Western Mediterranean Sea because of its different oceanographic characteristics. We developed a model of the study area representing early 2010s, covering a total area of 7085 km2, and including the continental shelf and upper slope with depths from 50 to 800 m. In total, 45 functional groups considering all components of the food web (fish, marine mammals, seabirds, invertebrates, primary producers, and detritus) were selected to build the ecological model. The fishery was represented by the four main fleets operating in the area (i.e., bottom trawl, purse seine, longlines, and small-scale fisheries) and we included official landing data and estimated percentage of discarded species. Results were then compared with available outputs of available models representing adjacent ecosystems such as the Gulf of Cadiz (in the Atlantic side) and the North Western Mediterranean Sea (north of the study area). The study revealed that the major differences found between models were due to the lower primary production in the GoA. This led to lower catches and higher importance of the demersal compartment, where the most biomass was associated to the detritus. The main trophic flows in the GoA were originated at the basis of the food web, likely related to bottom-up flow control. Interactions between pelagic and demersal groups were weaker than in neighboring areas. Despite the high values of ecotrophic efficiencies and mortality rates, results showed a lower fishing pressure than in neighboring areas, suggesting a moderate exploitation level of marine resources in the GoA. This study fills a knowledge gap in the area and sets the baseline to develop future studies to test scenarios of change and management options. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.;English;Article;All Open Access, Green;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;Mediterranean - non CS;>100,000;NA;NA;year;Simulated dynamics;NA;EwE;3;3;3;NA;no fishing scenarios are explored, only the exploitation status of functional groups are derived from EwE with no dynamics;4.4;Modelling/simulation;Foodweb;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Girardin

The last remaining healthy group of the endangered Mediterranean common dolphin subpopulation is located in the Alboran Sea. Their feeding grounds overlap with the fishing grounds of trawlers targeting European hake (Merluccius merluccius) and blue whiting (Micromessistius poutassou) as well as purse seiners targeting small pelagic species such as European sardine (Sardina pilchardus), European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), horse mackerel (Trachurus spp.) and mackerel (Scomber spp.). In the present study, we estimated that individual common dolphins in the Alboran Sea have a food consumption of 3.35 ± 0.67 kg/day, based on scaling equations applied to stranded animals. This figure is similar to the ones reported for other European populations. Although common dolphins mainly feed on mesopelagic species of none or little commercial interest, they also feed on commercial species, which could lead to a potential conflict with fisheries in the area. We estimated common dolphins in the Alboran Sea could consume more than 16,000 tonnes of fish annually, including ca 7365 (95% CI: 3838–11,639) tonnes of Madeira lanternfish (Ceratoscopelus maderensis), 2,888 (1123–5223) tonnes of bogue (Boops boops), 2770 (879–5270) tonnes of European sardine, 1,850 (170–4116) tonnes of gobies (Gobiidae), and 1497 (65–3352) tonnes of European hake (reference period 2006-2011).

Therefore, it is of great importance to evaluate the different impacts of such industries, in order to enable reasonable and sustainable decisions on environmental issues (e.g., nature conservation). Bottom trawling has a significant impact on benthic habitats worldwide. Fishing gear penetrates the seabed and the resulting furrows temporarily remain in the sediment known as trawl marks (TM), which can be recognized in the acoustic signal of side-scan sonars (SSS) and multibeam echo sounders (MBES). However, extensive mapping and precise descriptions of TM from commercial fisheries at far offshore fishing grounds in the German EEZ are not available. To get an insight into the spatial patterns and characteristics of TM, approximately 4800 km2 of high-resolution (1 m) SSS data from three different study sites in the German EEZ were analyzed for changes in TM density as well as for the geometry of individual TM. TM were manually digitalized and their density per square kilometer was calculated. In general, TM density was highest in August and October. Moreover, different gear types could be identified from investigating individual TM in SSS data. Beam trawl marks were observed to have widths of up to 22 m whereas otter board marks showed widths up to 6 m. The persistence of TM was estimated to 2–7 days minimum for all three sites based on the SSS data from 2015–2019. A maximum persistence could be defined at one site (Dogger Bank) and it was five months for the investigation period 2016–2017. Besides the main factors driving TM degradation (wave-base impact, sediment-type), different methods for TM detection (SSS, MBES, under-water video) are discussed. The study provides valuable information on the physical impact of bottom trawling on the seabed and can support existing monitoring strategies. © 2020 by the authors.

Our knowledge on large spatio-temporal patterns of demersal fish composition remains incomplete for the Mediterranean Sea. We investigated (1) the spatio-temporal stability of demersal assemblages, (2) the relationships between these assemblages and potential structuring factors (trawling pressure and environmental conditions) in order to assess the dynamic of the assemblage structure at the scale of the northern Mediterranean Sea. We analysed a dataset of 18062 hauls from 10 to 800 m depth performed annually during the last two decades across 17 Geographical Sub-Areas (GSAs) (MEDITS program). A multi-table analysis (STATICO-CoA) evidenced a strong inter-GSAs stability in the organization of assemblages, with specificities for some GSAs. The most stable structuring factors were linked to combined gradients of chlorophyll a, phytoplancton carbon biomass and temperature, inversely correlated with depth, salinity and nutrient gradients (axis 1 of the STATICO-CoA compromise, 93.74% of the total variability). A common pattern linking the distribution of species to these environmental gradients was evidenced for most of the 17 GSAs.

This issue has been evidenced from historical ecological studies and from the evaluation of the effects of effective and large marine protected areas. In two fishery reserves off the northern Sicily coast the red mullet Mullus barbatus underwent an impressive biomass increment and a few piscivores fish species recovered after a trawl ban. The red mullet, more than 20% of all demersal fish in the untrawled areas, represented a huge food resource to its potential predators. By contrasting two trawled and two untrawled gulfs we figured out predator - prey relationships through the use of a combined approach based on trophic niche, stable isotopes data and biomass. We show that the white grouper Epinephelus aeneus and the black-bellied anglerfish Lophius budegassa are the most important predators of the red mullet with higher biomass in the untrawled areas. We also found a potential re-establishment of the trophic role for white grouper inside the untrawled areas. Our study highlights some of the benefits obtained from the use of large offshore marine protected areas as a tool for ecosystem restoration. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;Mediterranean - non CS;>100,000;quarter;1,000-5,000;snapshot/no repeat sampling;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;Stable isotope analysis _ permutational ANOVAs;2;1;2;the difference in biomass between trawled and untrawled gulfs is of impressive biological importance.;NA;4.4;Fisheries independent survey;Foodweb;NA;NA;NA;NA;Catch_and_bycatch;NA;trawl ban ;NA;Commercial;NA;NA;NA;Biomass of red mullet predators;Abundance/biomass/density;Negative;biomass of prey and predators in untrawled areas are significantly higher;Girardin

Although the impacts of mobile gear are well known, effects of passive gear (e.g. fish traps) upon structure have been little studied. We modified commercial traps for American lobster Homarus americanus and black sea bass Centropristis striata by attaching GoPro® cameras to ascertain the degree and nature of impacts to seafloor habitats. Customized traps were included within a line of 20 traps, deployed and retrieved according to standard commercial fishing practice. Less than 5% of traps landed directly on bedforms when deployed. However, during retrieval traps dragged along the ocean floor, increasing trap-habitat contact rate to 50%, and causing traps to collide with corals, bryozoans, and other epifauna. Drag time of traps depended on the position in the trap line. Experimentally extending the trap line reduced drag time during retrieval for traps near the distal end of the line. Our results show that impacts of commercial trap fishing can be substantial during trap retrieval, and that the impact depends on their location on a trap line. Fishing practices should be developed that minimize effects of trap retrieval on structural benthic habitat. © 2018 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.;English;Article;All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green;Scopus;EXCLUDE on location;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;US coast;4.3;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Girardin

The fishing sector, in the Alboran Sea, is economically and culturally one of the most important and relies on overexploited target species such as European hake (Merlucius merlucius). Here we identified and quantified the impact of human pressures on the capacity of marine habitats to support the provision of food as an important ecosystem service. We modelled the spatial distribution of nursery areas of European hake in the Alboran Sea, using General Additive Models (GAM) and overlaid those with European Nature Information System (EUNIS) habitats. A sensitivity analysis of hake nursery areas to cumulative human impacts identified the Bay of Malaga as the most sensitive area with trawling frequencies up to 60 times higher than the habitats recovery time. Further, we identified an increased conflict potential among human activities such as trawling and extraction with the presence of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), which provide MPAs a high vulnerability similar to that found in unprotected areas. Future scenarios considering the increase of renewable energy and alternative food production show conflicts between aquaculture and MPAs as well as offshore wind farms and offshore shipping. Hence, our results show strong arguments for an integrated spatial management approach, including benthic trawling. We also suggest restricting trawling activities inside MPAs to safeguard the habitats capacity to support ecosystem services.

The analysis of sea trout captures was based on tagging and recapture data collected in 1998–2011, while whitefish data were derived from individual samples of commercial fisheries from the same period. The mesh sizes used in gill-net fishing and the seasonal and temporal distributions of recaptured sea trout and sampled whitefish were compared in the northern and southern Gulf of Bothnia. The trout had typically spent 1–2 years at sea, and they were mainly immature with a median body length of 40–43 cm at the time of recapture in gill nets. Despite the increase in the minimum permitted landing size from 40 to 50 cm in 2008, the median length of recaptured trout remained unchanged during the study period. Most (59%) of the gillnetted trout were caught in the southern Gulf of Bothnia in gill nets with mesh sizes of 40–45 mm, which were also used in the whitefish fishery (72%). In the northern Gulf of Bothnia, nets with a smaller mesh size of 25–39 mm took 83% of the whitefish catch and 39% from recaptured trout. In both areas, the overlap in mesh sizes used to gill-net catch whitefish and sea trout increased during the study period.

The North Adriatic Sea (central Mediterranean) is a major feeding habitat for turtles in the demersal stage. Its shallow and flat seabed is ideal for bottom-towed gears, making interactions with sea turtles and incidental catches unavoidable.

Geometric parameters computed from the acquired swath bathymetry revealed mean wave lengths of ~2000 m, and maximum wave heights of ~60 m. Single-channel reflection seismic profiles provided information on the sediment wave internal structure and the Quaternary stratigraphic architecture of the GoR outer shelf and slope. Seven main seismic units could be identified, with continuous development of sediment waves over the outer continental shelf and upper slope, showing differences in wave height and length. The seismic units are differentiated by erosional surfaces that can be followed from the outer shelf down the slope, and which have been correlated with Pleistocene eustatic oscillations. Sediment cores were collected over the sediment wave crests and troughs, and grain size distribution and sediment accumulation rates were analysed. Results show a dominant fraction of fine sediments, allowing classifying the observed bedforms as mud waves. Calculated sediment accumulation rates ranged between 0.08 and 0.18 cm/y, with no clear sedimentation pattern (e.g. differential sediment deposition rates) observed between wave crests and troughs. Nevertheless, the presence of thick surface mixed layers and the increase of the sand fraction in the upper sections of the cores indicate that the surface sediments are affected by bottom trawling activities, since the area is highly impacted by this human activity. The sediment waves observed over the GoR slope are most likely to be formed by bottom currents generated by overflows of dense water originated in the Gulf of Lions shelf, which cascade downslope in an oblique angle with respect the main bathymetric contours. This study offers new insights on the role of dense shelf water cascading processes and associated off-shelf sediment transport reshaping the morphology of the open-slope regions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;Mediterranean - non CS;>100,000;month;1,000-5,000;snapshot/no repeat sampling;Other;NA;Digital Terrain Model;2;1;1;Although there is a high anthropogenic disturbance over the continental shelf and upper slope, natural processes such as bottom currents are the most likely main mechanism for the sediment wave development.;Use raw VMS data position as proxies for fishing intensity, without separation of trawling and fishing time;4.3;Fisheries independent survey;Physical_habitats;NA;NA;NA;NA;Physical disturbance of the seabed;NA;fishing intensity;NA;Commercial;NA;NA;NA;sediment type;Other;Multiple;high anthropogenic disturbance over the continental shelf and upper slope;Girardin

To assess whether there have been significant trawling-induced alterations in the sediment dynamics within the Foix Canyon (Northwestern Mediterranean) during the past century, sediment accumulation rates obtained using 210Pb and 137Cs radiochronology were compared between sediment cores retrieved in 1993 and in 2013 from the canyon axis at 860 m depth. The results indicate an almost two-fold increase in the sedimentation rate in the 1960–70s, from 0.5 cm·y-1 to 0.9 cm·y-1, as a consequence of the rapid industrialization of the fishing sector at that time. Sedimentation rates further doubled to 1.8 cm·y-1 in the early 2000s. This period was characterized by the construction of bigger trawlers with more powerful engines as well as the modernization of the engines of existing vessels, all of which were largely under-declared. These results provide compelling evidence of the increasing impact of bottom trawling due to the modernization of trawling fleets at the beginning of the XXIst century. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;Mediterranean - non CS;5,000-10,000;multidecadal;0-5;snapshot/no repeat sampling;Other;NA;visual _ constant sedimentation (CF:CS) model;1;1;1;In submarine canyon environments, sediment resuspended in the wake of the heavy trawling gear can be displaced towards the adjacent canyon axis.

Four commercial boats using beam trawls were chartered and catch data were recorded from a total of 87 hauls. The hauls were performed at a depth of 7.1-28.3 meters for a duration of 20-77 min and the hauling speed varied between 1.4-2.7 knots. About 28 species were identified as bycatch, on an average this amounted to 11.4% of the total number of specimens. There were identified two different groups in the bycatch (G1: 7-18 m, G2: 19-26 m) based on the depth. Although there was noticed a decline in the volume of bycatch in group G2, it was not significant between the groups (p > 0.05). According to the results of the Generalized Additive Models (GAM), the variables affecting the by-catch amount were identified as a fishing area, depth, haul duration, and the amount of captured rapa whelk (p < 0.01). In addition, a large proportion of immature individuals of striped venus clams (Chamelea gallina), blood cockles (Anadara kagoshimensis), Mediterranean mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and wedge clams (Donax trunculus) were caught as bycatch during the exploration.

Since human pressures are suggested to shorten their reproductive lifespan, basic knowledge on reproduction is strongly required. One parameter is the onset of sexual maturity in female harbour porpoises. Therefore, we investigated the first signs of sexual maturity for a period of almost two decades (1990–2016). Ovaries from 111 female harbour porpoises from the German North Sea and Baltic Sea were examined for the presence and morphological structure of follicles, corpora lutea and corpora albicantia. Based on the ovarian characteristics we performed the first model-based estimation of age at sexual maturity for harbour porpoises from German waters. Additionally, we produced a demographical age structure based on all female strandings and bycatches from German coasts. Our results showed that corpora lutea and corpora albicantia as signs of former ovulation could be found in individuals at an age of 4.95 (± 0.6) years. No significant differences between specimens from the North Sea and Baltic Sea were detected. However, the average age at death differed significantly with 5.70 (± 0.27) years for North Sea animals and 3.67 (± 0.30) years for those in the Baltic Sea. Growing evidence exists that the shortened lifespan of Baltic Sea harbour porpoises is linked to an anthropogenically influenced environment with rising bycatch mortalities due to local gillnet fisheries. Thus, our findings support the idea of local management plans based on a model-based detection of age at sexual maturity and considering the anthropogenic impacts on the population for effective protection of harbour porpoises and the North Sea and Baltic Sea. © 2017 Kesselring et al.

Bycatch mortality from fisheries is clearly among the most serious global threats for marine ecosystems, affecting a wide range of top predators. Recent estimates report ca. 200,000 seabirds killed annually by bycatch in European waters. However, there is an urgent need to rigorously estimate actual mortality rates and quantify effects of bycatch on populations. The Mediterranean Sea is one of the most impacted regions. Here, we estimate for the first time both bycatch mortality rates and their population-level effects on three endemic and vulnerable Mediterranean taxa: Scopoli's shearwater, Mediterranean shag, and Audouin's gull, that die in different types of fishing gears: longlines, gillnets and sport trolling, respectively. We use multi-event capture–recapture modelling to estimate crucial demographic parameters, including the probabilities of dying in different fishing gears. We then build stochastic demography models to forecast the viability of the populations under different management scenarios. Longline bycatch was particularly severe for adults of Scopoli's shearwaters and Audouin's gulls (ca. 28% and 23% of total mortality, respectively) and also for immature gulls (ca. 90% of mortality). Gillnets had a lower impact, but were still responsible for ca. 9% of juvenile mortality on shags, whereas sport trolling only slightly influenced total mortality in gulls. Bycatch mortality has high population-level impacts in all three species, with shearwaters having the highest extinction risk under current mortality rates. Different life-history traits and compensatory demographic mechanisms between the three species are probably influencing the different bycatch impact: for shearwaters, urgent conservation actions are required to ensure the viability of their populations. Results will be very useful for guiding future seabird conservation policies and moving towards an ecosystem-based approach to sustainable fisheries management. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd;English;Article;All Open Access, Green;Scopus;NA;CS - Mediterranean;>100,000;five year;100-500;snapshot/no repeat sampling;Simulated dynamics;Fisheries dependent _ independant data;multi-event capture–recapture modelling;2;2;3;Longlines in particular are responsible for the highest mortality, whereas the effects of gillnets and sport fishing are estimated to be relatively low in our study_Nevertheless, the extremely low survival found in the present study, especially for immature Scopoli’s shearwaters, suggests that anthropogenic mortality will be largely additive.;two concluding statement that seems relevant for seawise;4.2;Modelling/simulation;Seabirds;NA;NA;NA;Calonectris diomedea diomedea;Catch_and_bycatch;Bycatch;number of entanglement;NA;Commercial;Hooks_and_lines;Longline;NA; extinction probability;Mortality;Negative;high probability 0.95;Girardin

Bycatch mortality from fisheries is clearly among the most serious global threats for marine ecosystems, affecting a wide range of top predators. Recent estimates report ca. 200,000 seabirds killed annually by bycatch in European waters. However, there is an urgent need to rigorously estimate actual mortality rates and quantify effects of bycatch on populations. The Mediterranean Sea is one of the most impacted regions. Here, we estimate for the first time both bycatch mortality rates and their population-level effects on three endemic and vulnerable Mediterranean taxa: Scopoli's shearwater, Mediterranean shag, and Audouin's gull, that die in different types of fishing gears: longlines, gillnets and sport trolling, respectively. We use multi-event capture–recapture modelling to estimate crucial demographic parameters, including the probabilities of dying in different fishing gears. We then build stochastic demography models to forecast the viability of the populations under different management scenarios. Longline bycatch was particularly severe for adults of Scopoli's shearwaters and Audouin's gulls (ca. 28% and 23% of total mortality, respectively) and also for immature gulls (ca. 90% of mortality). Gillnets had a lower impact, but were still responsible for ca. 9% of juvenile mortality on shags, whereas sport trolling only slightly influenced total mortality in gulls.

The model incorporates seal diet preference, population size and commercial fishery catch, with survey data to quantify ecological interactions between seals and fisheries. Total annual consumption by seals was an order of magnitude less than the catch of the modelled trawl fishery. Increasing fishing pressure reduced fish spawning stock biomass (SSB) much more than a proportionally equivalent increase in seal predation. For most fish species, quadrupling seal predation showed little effect on the predicted fishery catch. These results arise from relatively low seal abundance and partial niche partitioning. The fishery harvested a wider range of fish lengths and species than seals consumed. The fish community was dominated by small fish lengths and seals predated on these more than suggested by their calculated diet preference. Seal predation disproportionately affected several fish species not targeted by the fishery, but seal predation did not significantly affect the SSB of any of the species that constitute 90% of the total landings of the fishery. Synthesis and applications. Predation of fish by grey and harbour seals is unlikely to harm commercial trawl fisheries in south-west Irish waters. This conclusion differs from those of some model-based studies of other North Atlantic systems, demonstrating the need for ecosystem-specific evidence in considering such conflicts. In systems with low niche overlap between seals and fisheries, the two are largely decoupled in effect, leaving fishing pressure as the overwhelming determinant of targeted fish stock status. © 2016 British Ecological Society.;English;Article;All Open Access, Bronze;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;impact of seals on fishing and target species biomass;4.4;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Girardin

The main aim of our investigationwas to describe the prevalence of discarding and its evolution over the past 70 years using information gathered through individual questionnaire-based interviews with fishers from ports in Spain, Italy, and Greece, following a standardized sampling protocol. Although it proved impossible to derive absolute estimates of the volume of discarded catches over the period investigated, we conclude that over the past 70 years, discarding as a practice has gradually increased in the northern Mediterranean trawl fisheries and has been accompanied by a shift in the species composition of the discarded catch. While discarding can occur for a number of reasons, our investigations indicate that discarding in the past was mostly driven by market demand, but recent legal and regulatory constraints have led to changes in fishing strategies and became a significant reason for discards. © 2015 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

However uncertainties and deficiencies with available data hamper traditional, quantitative assessment methods of stock status to inform those plans, and thus effective management. The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) Expert Groups have explored a range of data deficient assessment methods that may be used to support management advice, including Productivity Susceptibility Analysis (PSA). This method was applied to the demersal elasmobranch fauna (21 species) of the Celtic Sea to explore how such approaches could inform the management of skates (Rajidae). This species complex is an important catch component for demersal trawl and gillnet fisheries and is currently managed under a mixed species total allowable catch (TAC). PSAs were conducted on both of these fisheries, by four experts from three countries to introduce independence, and to quantify the range in perceptions of each stock. Confidence scoring of attributes was incorporated and probability distributions generated to model uncertainty in the expert responses to susceptibility attributes.

Short-term availability of trawl-damaged prey, and longer-term shifts in benthic prey community composition, both have the potential to affect feeding opportunities and realized dietary preferences of bottom-feeding (benthivorous) fish. To investigate these effects of bottom-fishing activity (by otter trawls, beam trawls, and dredges) on the feeding of benthivorous fish, we compared the trophic level at body size and diets of four species in areas of the Celtic Sea subject to low, intermediate, and high fishing activity. Trophic level was estimated using nitrogen stable isotope analysis, and fishing activity was quantified with vessel monitoring system (VMS) data. For whiting (Merlangius merlangus) of all sizes, trophic level was slightly lower in areas of higher fishing activity. After accounting for the results of the diet analysis, we concluded that this reflected increased scavenging of benthic invertebrates in more intensively fished areas. For megrim (Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis), the rate of increase in trophic level with size was lower with increasing fishing activity, implying that megrim may also substitute fish with lower-trophic invertebrates that can be scavenged in more intensively fished areas. For plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and lemon sole (Microstomus kitt), no significant effects of fishing activity on trophic level were detected. We conclude that differences in the intensity of fishing activity with towed bottom gears had small but variable effects of the trophic size structure of the four species, and that this primarily reflected scavenging rather than diet changes following longer-term shifts in composition of the prey community. © 2013 © 2013 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

The relationship between fishing mortality and effort exerted by the English beam trawl fleet is investigated for two stocks of North Sea demersal fish, plaice, Pleuronectes platessa L., and sole, Solea solea (L.). Catchability was adjusted by accounting for targeting by this gear, seasonal and area effects, and individual vessel variation, using results from a generalised linear mixed-effects model (GLMM) that included random effects (in this case, vessel). Descriptors were standardised in relation to distinct submétiers and their impact on both species. Fishing efficiency was calculated as the ratio between relative nominal landings per unit effort derived from the GLMM and survey indices from a standard survey vessel. Fishing efficiency for sole increased (+0.6% annually) and for plaice decreased (-6.2%), likely because of changes in targeting, fuel costs and regulations. © 2013 Crown.;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;CS - North Sea;>100,000;decade;10,000-50,000;day;Fisheries Dependent Data;NA;linear regression ;2;2;3;NA;NA;none;NA;Fish_teleost;Flatfish;NA;NA;Pleuronectes platessa _ Solea solea;Catch_and_bycatch;Target;effort;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;Beam trawl;Pleuronectes platessa _ Solea solea;fishing mortality;Mortality;Positive;high;Girardin

S., and Strehlow, H. V. 2013. Dead or alive - estimating post-release mortality of Atlantic cod in the recreational fishery. - ICES Journal of Marine Science, 70: 864-872.Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) is one of the most important commercial and recreational target species in European marine waters. Recent recreational fisheries surveys revealed that recreational cod catches and release rates are substantial compared to the commercial fishery, particularly in the western Baltic Sea. Despite high release rates, no literature exists exploring the post-release mortality of cod and potential sublethal effects after catch-and-release in recreational fisheries. This study investigates (i) the post-release mortality of undersized cod, (ii) potential factors affecting mortality, and (iii) consequences of the catch-and-release process on cod. During four experimental trials, western Baltic Sea cod were angled from a charter vessel and thereafter observed together with control fish in netpens for 10 d at holding temperatures between 6.2 and 19.8°C. Adjusted mortality rates for angled cod ranged from 0.0-27.3% (overall mean 11.2%). A logistic regression analysis revealed that bleeding and holding-water temperature were the only significant predictors of mortality. Slow hook injury healing (>10 d) and bacterial wound infections were observed in some surviving cod. The results will help to increase the accuracy of recreational cod removal estimates and thereby improve the management of western Baltic cod stock. © 2013 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.;English;Article;All Open Access, Bronze;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;focus on post release survival of recreational fishing without assessment of the global recreational fishing pressure or proportion of released fished;none;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Girardin

SW4_0988;E4;Papatheodorou G.;Floating and benthic marine litter in the Mediterranean Sea: Typology, abundance, sources, survey methods and impacts on marine biota;2012;Life in the Mediterranean Sea: A Look at Habitat Changes;;;557;593;;;The study of marine litter has become an interesting issue for many scientists over the last three decades, given the significant environmental and economic impacts involved. Marine litter may be found in a wide range of environments from shore and shallow waters to abyssal oceanic basins. Marine debris can be found very close to the source or can be transported to remote mid-ocean islands by ocean currents and winds. This globally distributed pattern is caused by a wide variety of oceanographic and sedimentological processes, which include wind/wave and prevailing currents, oceanic fronts and eddies in convergence zones, estuarine bottom salinity fronts and hyperpycnal and turbidity currents. Sources of marine litter can be categorised into land- and marine-based. Land litter sources are urban, municipal and industrial landfills. Land-originated litter enters the marine environment via rivers, municipal drainage systems, ephemeral streams and sewage inputs and by beachgoers. Marine or ocean-based litter sources are commercial and recreational fishing, shipping (merchant, ferries and recreational boats) and aquaculture installations.Due to limitations from the accessibility and selection of litter items, marine debris has mostly been examined on beach surveys, and only a few studies have focused on floating litter and seabed distribution. The most common methodologies used for floating and benthic litter investigation are (i) visual inspection of the sea surface, (ii) diving techniques in shallow water and (iii) trawling sampling and submersibles in the continental shelves and deep seas. Marine litter studies usually classify collected items according to the material of which they are made and for what they are used and include calculation of densities for each defined type and estimations for the selected water column or seabed.From the reviewed literature, the Mediterranean Sea presents the greatest litter pollution in both the water column and seabed in terms of density. Calculated densities of floating litter in the Mediterranean Sea show a high variability and range from 0.12 to 2,000 item/km2. The average benthic litter density for this sea is estimated to be 42 items/ha. This value is one order of magnitude greater than estimations for the Atlantic (2.08 item/ha) and Pacific Oceans (1.07 item/ha), which is due to the unique morphology (i.e., it is almost enclosed by land) of the Mediterranean Sea and the combination of its densely populated coastline, the intense shipping in its waters and the large number of river inflows into the Mediterranean Sea. Litter densities are not homogeneously distributed on the Mediterranean seabed, showing very high values at the shallow coastal zone (<25 m), significantly lower values over the continental shelf (<200 m) and elevated densities in deeper waters. Plastic is the dominant litter material (61.4%) in the Mediterranean Sea. The spatial distribution of benthic litter shows that river inputs and the river canyon-deep sea fan system are major contributing factors to the amount of litter in the Mediterranean Sea, which indicates the importance of land-based sources.Although, limited studies exist regarding the impacts of marine litter to biota of Mediterranean Sea, these impacts are expected to grow in importance in the future. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In the eastern North Atlantic, at least 1000 common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) are bycaught each year, particularly in pelagic pair-trawls. We have assessed the resulting impact of bycatch on this population using a demographic modeling approach. We relied on a sample of females stranded along the French Atlantic and western Channel coasts. Strandings represent an extensive source of demographic information to monitor our study population. Necropsy analysis provided an estimate of individual age and reproductive state. Then we estimated effective survivorship (including natural and human-induced mortality), age at first reproduction and pregnancy rates. Reproductive parameters were consistent with literature, but effective survivorship was unexpectedly low. Demographic parameters were then used as inputs in two models. A constant parameter matrix proposed an effective growth rate of -5.5±0.5%, corresponding to the current situation (including bycatch mortality). Subsequently, deterministic projections suggested that the population would be reduced to 20% of its current size in 30 years and would be extinct in 100 years. The demographic invariant model suggested a maximum growth rate of +4.5±0.09%, corresponding to the optimal demographic situation. Then, a risk analysis incorporating Potential Biological Removal (PBR), based on two plausible scenarii for stock structure suggested that bycatch level was unsustainable for the neritic population of the Bay of Biscay under a two-stock scenario. In depth assessment of stock structure and improved observer programs to provide scientifically robust bycatch estimates are needed. Effective conservation measures would be reducing bycatch to less than 50% of the current level in the neritic stock to reach PBR. Our approach provided indicators of the status and trajectory of the common dolphin population in the eastern North Atlantic and therefore proved to be a valuable tool for management, applicable to other dolphin populations. © 2012 Mannocci et al.;English;Article;All Open Access, Gold, Green;Scopus;NA;CS - Western Waters;>100,000;multidecadal;0-5;snapshot/no repeat sampling;Other;Observer program _ stranding network;Siler competing-risk model;2;2;3;a risk analysis based on Potential Biological Removal suggested that the current bycatch level was likely too high for the neritic stock, when considering the two-stock scenario.;only fishing is considered in the scenarios no variation of environment;4.2;Modelling/simulation;Marine_mammals;Cetaceans;Toothed_cetacean;NA;Delphinus delphis;Catch_and_bycatch;Bycatch;bycatch;NA;Commercial;Pelagic_trawls;NA;tuna;probability of exceeding Potential Biological Removal;Survival;Negative;low;Girardin

Birds and fisheries concentrated in the same areas. Vulnerability and potential conflict were highest during winter and spring in coastal waters and around shallow offshore grounds. Local bycatch studies validated the usefulness of our approach, which can provide a valuable tool for conservation purposes. Although the conflict analysis outlined the current extent of overlap between birds and fisheries, the vulnerability index indicated important areas and periods in terms of diving bird abundance, irrespective of fisheries, and enabled the development of appropriate conservation and management options. A suite of measures including temporal or spatial restrictions can be derived, despite a scarcity of real data for bycatch rates. This approach is particularly useful for assessing impacts that are difficult to monitor and where mortality cannot be properly addressed, as in artisanal gillnet fisheries. It is also generally applicable to any marine area or species worldwide. © 2012 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Published by Oxford University Press.

Here, based on an analysis of the impacts of the scallop dredge fleet around the Isle of Man, Irish Sea, we show how fishing and the physicalenvironment act to determine the biomass and size composition of emergent epifauna. The epifauna create habitat structure that is used by juvenile scallops and other species, thus providing an important ecosystem service. Epifauna were identified and quantified basedon photographs taken during an extensive survey of the territorial waters of the Isle of Man. On hard substrata, the effect of tidal velocity on total biomass (g m -2) and the maximum size (g) of the largest organism encountered in each taxon was positive while wave stress and fishing frequency had a negative impact. We used the results to predict the distribution of biomass and maximum size and to quantify the total effects of fishing. Fishing frequency was the most important factor that affected maximum size of the epifauna, resulting in a mean decrease in size of 17% (range 0 to 66%).

Scaldfish were collected in MayJune 2005 using a commercial otter trawler between 40 and 80m on muddy bottoms. Our data show that scaldfish is a selective feeder and consumes similar prey items in the three gulfs, although between-site differences in the relative prey abundance in the stomachs were detected. In the three gulfs scaldfish fed mainly on the crab Goneplax rhomboides and on the fish Lesueurigobius suerii, but there was an increase in the consumption of L. suerii and the shrimp Alpheus glaber in the trawled areas. Ontogenetic changes were evident in the diet of scaldfish, with juveniles preying mainly upon suprabenthic species, e.g. mysids and small decapods. While significant differences occurred in the diet of juveniles among all areas due to natural spatial variability, variations in the diet of adults, which feed on benthic prey, occurred between untrawled and trawled areas. These variations were clearly due to trawling disturbance, and no significant difference was detected in the diet of adults between the two trawled areas. On the contrary, the trophic level (15N values) of scaldfish did not vary between trawled and untrawled areas and between juveniles and adults.

Fisheries bycatch has been implicated in declines of many long-lived marine vertebrate populations, but bycatch impacts on these populations vary according to spatio-temporal overlap in fisheries operations and critical ontogenetic habitat, as well as to characteristics of fishing gear. 2. To provide a framework for comparing the relative impacts of different fisheries on populations of loggerhead sea turtles Caretta caretta, we compiled published data on sizes of individual loggerheads taken as bycatch in North Atlantic, North Pacific and Mediterranean fisheries, and used Leslie matrix models to calculate reproductive values (RVs) for bycatch samples of loggerheads within these basins. 3. Sizes and RVs of loggerheads varied significantly based on spatial overlap in fisheries and ontogenetic habitat as well as on fishing gear. Thus, fisheries operating in areas occupied by larger, older turtles (e.g. trawls in neritic areas) tended to interact with more reproductively 'valuable' turtles than fisheries that operated in areas occupied by smaller, younger turtles (e.g. oceanic and pelagic longlines). 4. We also found evidence of size-selectivity among different fishing gears (e.g. wider size variation among loggerheads taken in driftnets and trawls than in longlines) and gear configuration (e.g. smaller loggerheads in shallow longline sets using small hooks). 5. These results suggest that evaluation of fishery impacts on marine megafauna require characterization of fishery activities;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Only about 10 active purse seiners (4 % of the total active fishing fleet) were responsible for 33 % of the biomass removal, and likely had the greatest impact on prey of common dolphins.

Results showed that large modifications occurred in the communities and sediments of the central part of the ""Grande Vasière"", while these modifications remained moderate in the surroundings on the outer continental shelf. Revisited, macrobenthic communities differed greatly from those recorded in the 1960s, and were less numerous and more homogeneous. The dominant species which characterized the communities and sub-communities had also changed. The main factor that can explain these differences is the granulometry of the sediments which has shown large changes: a strong decrease in the mud fraction and increase in the fine sand fraction. These sedimentary changes should be linked with human activities: increase in bottom trawling effort that induces the resuspension of fine mud particles and the homogenization of sediments over large areas, and decrease in terrigenous particulate fluxes due to anthropic activities on the shoreline and in coastal waters. Effects of global climatic change on the observed evolution remain low, even if some species common in the south of the Bay of Biscay in the 1960s but rare or absent in the north, had increased in density and spread to the north. Trawling activities are probably the main force driving benthic community evolution in the North Bay of Biscay both through direct action on the fauna (inhibition and facilitation processes) and indirect action by modifying sediment characteristics. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

SW4_1368;E4;Poulsen B., Holm P., MacKenzie B.R.;A long-term (1667-1860) perspective on impacts of fishing and environmental variability on fisheries for herring, eel, and whitefish in the Limfjord, Denmark;2007;Fisheries Research;87;02/Mar;181;195;10.1016/j.fishres.2007.07.014;;This investigation reconstructs the development of major fisheries for herring, eel and whitefish in the Limfjord estuary, Denmark ca. 1667-1860, and then evaluates how their long-term dynamics have been influenced by some key fishery and environmental developments. The commercially most important fishery was for herring, Clupea harengus, which spawned in the Limfjord. This fishery underwent large changes in these centuries. High landings occurred in two periods in the early 18th and again in the early 19th centuries, when 4000-8000 metric tonnes were caught annually. In 1830, the fishery collapsed and landings were <1000 tonnes until the 1910s. Even during the 20th century using modern fishing techniques, the herring fishery never exceeded 7000 tonnes. The collapse was most likely due to unsustainable fishing practices (direct impacts on adults, juveniles, larvae and eggs). The second most important fishery of the Limfjord was the eel fishery. Eel, Anguilla anguilla, seems to have fled the fjord after a winter storm in 1825 broke the narrow Agger Tange isthmus which used to separate the Limfjord from the North Sea, and permanently increased the salinity in the western part of the Limfjord from 8 psu to 33 psu. The, so-called pulse seine fishery for eel declined rapidly following the salt water intrusion, and the population needed at least one to two generations to even partly recover. One possible technological reason for the recovery of the fishery was the 1848 invention of a new type of gear in the Limfjord which today is known as the Danish seine. However, the commercial eel fishery in Limfjord ceased by the 1980s coincident with the overall decline in European eel populations. The third fishery analyzed is the fishery for common whitefish, Coregonus lavaretus. A local population formed the basis of a substantial seasonal fishery, but the whitefish did not survive the salinity obstacle presented by the salt water intrusion in 1825. This study documents both the effects of fishing and environmental variability on collapses of different Limfjord fish species. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of the present study was to establish baseline oiling levels for beached birds in the eastern Baltic. We also attempted to evaluate the influence of bird mortality in gillnets on the results of beached bird surveys. The coastal gillnet fishery, which was initiated and expanded along the Lithuanian coast over the course of our study period, caused an increase in waterbird mortality. The presence of mostly unoiled, gillnet-drowned birds among beached birds may have lowered the observed oiling rates and considerably affected beached bird species composition by increasing the proportion of diving birds. Nevertheless, we conclude that minimum oiling rates were high (27%) on the Lithuanian coast during our study, and this finding indicates the presence of chronic oil pollution in the area. We also concluded that beached bird surveys have limited value in studying bird bycatch issues. Beached bird surveys help to identify the existence of bird bycatch, the geographic scope of the problem and the bird species involved, but they do not allow for determining bycatch rates, fishing gear involved or the precise locations and circumstances of birds drowning - that is, the basic questions to be answered when analyzing fisheries bycatch.;English;Article;;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;CS - Baltic Sea;50,000-100,000;decade;1,000-5,000;snapshot/no repeat sampling;Visual Analyses of Quadrats/Transects;NA;logistic regression;NA;NA;NA;NA;no link with fishing pressure or population size to derive mortality.

According to international official sources, Morocco harbors the bulk of this fleet in the Mediterranean. To ascertain its biodiversity impact, 369 fishing operations (worth 4140 km of driftnets set) made by the driftnet fleet targeting swordfish (Xiphias gladius) based in Al Hoceima (Alboran Sea) were monitored between December 2002 and September 2003. Parallel surveys were made in the main Mediterranean ports and in that of Tangiers, in the Gibraltar Straits, to estimate the total fishing effort. Results showed an active driftnet fleet conservatively estimated at 177 units. Estimated average net length ranges from 6.5 to 7.1 km, depending on the port, though actual figures are suspected to be much higher (12-14 km). Most boats perform driftnet fishing all year round, resulting in very high annual effort levels. A total of 237 dolphins (short-beaked common dolphin, Delphinus delphis, and striped dolphin, Stenella coeruleoalba), 498 blue sharks (Prionace glauca), 542 shortfin makos (Isurus oxyrinchus) and 464 thresher sharks (Alopias vulpinus) were killed by the boats monitored during the sampling period, during the peak of the swordfish fishery, along with 2990 swordfish. Loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) was also caught (46 individuals). Estimates for a 12-month period by the whole driftnet fleet yielded 3110-4184 dolphins (both species) and 20,262-25,610 pelagic sharks distributed in roughly equal proportions for P. glauca, I. oxyrinchus and A. vulpinus, in the Alboran Sea alone;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In other open-sea Nephrops fisheries, such low salinity exposure is rare. Physiologically the species is described as being marine stenohaline, i.e. intolerant of reduced salinities, and a lower salinity limit of 29-30 for its distribution has been suggested. Using CTD data from the Anholt E hydrographic station, near to known Nephrops grounds, a knowledge of hauling times (including washing the cod-end with surface water) and of the sinking rate of Nephrops, we simulated conditions experienced by the catch in this fishery. We also included a period of emersion (air exposure) on deck during sorting or reshooting the trawl. Blood electrolytes, body mass changes and simple behavioural responses were examined before and after the simulation over a 5-day period. ""Discarded"" Nephrops experienced significant haemodilution and gained mass rapidly. Animals showed slow rates of ""tail-flipping"", or absence of responses to stimulation, in the period immediately following return to salinity 33 seawater, although many showed recovery later. Delayed effects included abdominal stiffness, swelling and further mortalities (25-42% overall). Controls (exposed to 33 psu seawater only) showed good survival and vigorous responses, even with a period of emersion. The effects of salinity exposure, which are additional to the stresses of being trawled, on the fitness of discarded animals were evaluated. Our results suggest that Nephrops discard mortality in this fishery is significantly higher than past estimates and is due to the stress of this brief exposure to low salinity surface water. © 2003 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

The purpose of the present study was to perform an environmental assessment for the entire life cycle of a seafood product and to include fishery-specific types of environmental impact in inventory and assessment. Environmental data for a frozen block of cod fillets was collected and used for a Life Cycle Assessment, including the fishery-specific environmental aspects seafloor use and biological extraction of target, by-catch and discard species. The fishery takes place in the Baltic Sea where cod is mainly fished by benthic trawls and gillnets. Methods. The functional unit was a consumer package of frozen cod fillets (400 g) reaching the household. Data was gathered from fishermen, fishery statistics, databases, companies and literature. Fishery-specific issues like the impact on stocks of the target and by-catch species, seafloor impact and discarding were quantified in relation to the functional unit and qualitative impact assessment of these aspects was included. Results. Findings include the fact that all environmental impact categories assessed (Global Warming Potential, Eutrophication Potential, Acidification Potential, Photochemical Ozone Creation Potential and Aquatic Ecotoxiciy) are dominated by the fishery. Around 700 m2 of seafloor are swept by trawls and around 50 g of under-sized cod and other marine species are discarded per functional unit. The phases contributing most to total environmental impact following fishery were transports and preparation in the household. The process industry and municipal sewage treatment cause considerable amounts of eutrophying emissions. Conclusions. Conclusions are that there are considerable options for improvement of the environmental performance of the seafood production chain. In the fishery, the most important environmental measure is to fish sustainably managed stocks. Speed optimisation, increased use of less energy-intensive fishing gear and improved engine and fuel technology are technical measures that would considerably decrease resource use and environmental impact caused by fishery. Due to the importance of fishery for the overall results, the most important environmental improvement option after landing is to maintain high quality and minimise product losses. Recommendations and Outlook. The need for good baseline data concerning resource use and marine environmental impact of fisheries in order to perform environmental assessment of seafood products was demonstrated. LCA was shown to be a valuable tool for such assessments, which in the future could be used to improve the environmental performance of the seafood production chain or in the development of criteria of eco-labelling of seafood products originating in capture fisheries.;English;Article;;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Life cycle analysis focussing more onto effect of fishing on global warming and mettalic pollution from anti-fouling with no link to the impact on ecosystem.

SW4_1615;E4;Svedäng H.;The inshore demersal fish community on the Swedish Skagerrak coast: Regulation by recruitment from offshore sources;2003;ICES Journal of Marine Science;60;1;23;31;10.1006/jmsc.2002.1329;;To elucidate the species composition, size structure and abundance of inshore demersal fish community on the Swedish Skagerrak coast relative to the offshore community, a series of seven trawl surveys have been made in 2000-2001 and the results have been compared with scattered information from historic sources. The results show that abundance of fish >30 cm is presently extremely low for most long-lived species compared to historical records from the 1920s to 1970s. Cod, haddock, whiting, plaice, dab, long rough dab all showed a marked shift of the size spectra to the smaller sizes. Flounder was a notable exception: the size distribution had even widened and included more smaller as well as larger fish than in the historical records. Because flounder is the only long-lived species that is coast-bound and stationary, local fishing activity is apparently not responsible for the observed shift in the less stationary species. Also, fishing in the coastal zone has presumably been reduced because of the absence of the size range suitable for consumption. Overall, the demersal fish catches were dominated by immature fish that disappear when they grow older and most likely migrate offshore. The persistently high abundance of juvenile fish and the absence of adult fish suggest that the inshore demersal fish populations are presently regulated by recruitment from offshore sources, while historical information indicate that spawning aggregations of several of these species were common in these areas. It was hence hypothesized that a major change of the inshore demersal community has taken place during the last twenty years: local (sub-)populations of demersal fish have been eradicated, and the inshore area has become more and more dependent on transport of recruits from offshore spawning areas. © 2003 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Research conducted since 1994 has shown that acoustic alarms (pingers) emitting high-frequency pulsed sounds effectively reduce the number of harbor porpoise Phocoena phocoena casualties in sink gillnets. However, the mechanisms behind the effects of pingers were still not understood. Until now, advantages and risks associated with their widespread use could not be evaluated. Here we present the results of 2 field experiments: (1) theodolite-tracking of harbor porpoises exposed to a single PICE-pinger in Clayoquot Sound, Vancouver Island, Canada and (2) herring Clupea harengus capture rates in surface gillnets equipped with and without acoustic alarms (Dukane Netmark 1000, Lien, PICE) in the Baltic Sea herring fishery at Rügen Island, Germany. Our results show that harbor porpoises do not seem to react to an experimental net in their foraging area (n = 172 groups, median group size = 2 porpoises). Porpoise distance from the mid-point of the net was distributed around a median of only 150 m (range 4 to 987 m). A net equipped with an acoustic alarm, however, was avoided (n = 44 groups) within audible range (distance distribution median = 530 m, range 130 to 1140 m). The porpoises were thus effectively excluded from the ensonified area. Herring, one of the main prey species of harbor porpoises, were not affected by the acoustic alarms tested (n = 25 407 fish captured). The advantages and risks of using acoustic alarms to mitigate by-catch are discussed.;English;Article;All Open Access, Bronze, Green;Scopus;EXCLUDE on location;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;pingers tested in canada, and effect of it on herring yield tested in the baltic Sea with no link to fishing pressure level nor depredation level nor bycatch;4.2;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Girardin

The sites examined have been exposed to differing known levels of fishing disturbance by scallop dredging, based on unusually high-resolution data extracted from fishermens' logbooks. Uni- and multi-variate techniques have been used on a production dataset (a value which incorporates both abundance and biomass figures), as well as abundance and biomass data individually. The original species list was reduced to higher taxonomic groupings in line with the theory that the latter is more appropriate for detecting anthropogenic change. Species diversity and richness, total number of species, and total number of individuals all decrease significantly with increasing fishing effort. Species dominance increases with effort. Total abundance, biomass and production, and the production of most of the major individual taxa investigated decrease significantly with increasing effort. Multivariate analysis reveals a significant relationship between fishing effort and by-catch assemblage structure. The taxa most responsible for the differences are the echinoids and cnidarians, but prosobranch molluscs and crustaceans also contribute to the differences. By-catch assemblage structure is more closely related to fishing effort than any other environmental parameter investigated, including depth and sediment type. We observed an approximately linear decrease in diversity with increasing fishing disturbance, and suggest this is primarily due to selective removal of sensitive species and, more importantly, habitat homogenisation. These results were interpreted in the light of ecological theories relating disturbance to community structure. The argument that invertebrate scavenger populations benefit from prolonged exposure to fishing disturbance was also examined, but no supporting evidence was found.;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;CS - Western Waters;>100,000;year;500-1,000;snapshot/no repeat sampling;Regular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;linear regression ;2;2;3;NA;NA;4.3;Fisheries independent survey;Benthos;NA;NA;NA;NA;Physical disturbance of the seabed;NA;effort;NA;Commercial;Dredges;NA;Pecten maximus _ Aequipecten opercularis;Species richness _ number of species _ Shannon Wiener diversity _ Simpson index;Biodiversity;Negative;high;Girardin

Some are actually not caught now in the south of the Bay of Biscay. Among these are the large bottom-living elasmobranchs with low reproduction rates, such as Echinorhinus brucus, Squatina squatina, Raja batis, Raja brachyura, Dasyatis pastinaca, Myliobatis aquila, Galeorhinus galeus, Mustelus asterias, Raja clavata, ... and some actinopterygians, such as Trigla lyra, while catches of Eutrigla gurnardus are much reduced. Bottom trawling is principally responsible for these reductions but all fishing methods used there have contributed, even to the loss of the large species.

Despite this, there is a surprising scarcity of biological and ecological information for this species. As artisanal fisheries have a very long tradition in the whole Mediterranean, a considerable impact of continuous fishing pressure is expected on this valuable rockfish. To elucidate some biological parameters that indicate the status of S.scrofa in the Adriatic Sea and to show which consequences high fishery effort may have on its age, growth and reproduction, sampling was carried out in the middle Adriatic using trammel nets. Temporal trends in body size/weight of S.scrofa were also assessed using long-term data including specimens caught from 1960 to 2010. Temporal trends of S.scrofa in the middle Adriatic indicated significant decreases of 19% in length and 43% in total weight over time. In contrast, official landings for the last five years showed an increase of 13%. However, this increasing trend most likely reflects the continuous change in national policies for reporting the catches. Both catch data and landings statistics showed peak in catch per unit effort during summer which coincides with spawning period of S.scrofa. Length at first sexual maturity was observed at 29.0cm for females and 24.9cm for males. All specimens larger than 32cm were mature. Age analysis revealed 15 age classes with a 25 year old female as the oldest specimen. However, age classes 3+ and 4+ were predominant in the total catch. The growth rate is relatively high during the first four years of life and afterwards it considerably slows down, with females growing at slightly slower rate and attaining slightly larger sizes than males. Given the identified biological implications that confirm our assumptions of inherent vulnerabilities and negative effects arising from continued artisanal fisheries practice, existing management should be complemented by a more holistic, ecosystem approach to regulations in order to assure more effective conservation measures for this large and slow-growing, long-lived fish. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;CS - Mediterranean;>100,000;multidecadal;10,000-50,000;week;Fisheries Dependent Data;NA;t-test , von Bertalanffy equation, non parametric Spearman correlation, Kolmogorov-Smirnov two sample test, multivariate Hotelling T2 - test, ANCOVA;2;2;3;NA;NA;4.2;Fisheries dependent survey;Fish_teleost;Roundfish;NA;Mixed;Scorpaena scrofa;Catch_and_bycatch;Target;Impact of artisanal fishery on the large red scorpionfish;NA;Commercial;Nets;Trammel net;inner mesh size 28 mm_ outer mesh size 150 mm;Catches;Size/age structure;Multiple;Attempts to determine trends in catches of S.scrofa show the difficulty in extracting a clear trend due to the continuous change in the DCF program and the policies of subsidies.;Lefkaditou_Chatzispyrou

Most of the studies were focused on highly developed industrial fisheries, overlooking bycatch in small-scale artisanal fisheries. However, bycatch in smallscale fisheries might have negative effects similar to those of industrial fisheries when they overlap with hotspot areas of top predators. Moreover, different types of fishing gear coexist in the same oceanographic area, particularly in highly exploited marine ecosystems such as the western Mediterranean. We quantify for the first time the influence of trawling regime on Cory's shearwater Calonectris diomedea bycatch in the western Mediterranean longline artisanal fishery. The availability of trawling discards has substantial influence on the foraging and reeding ecology of many seabirds, and trawling inactivity may drive shearwaters to seek alternative food resources, such as baits used in longline fishing. Based on our previous knowledge of the system, we also tested other variables affecting bycatch over 8 yr (1998 to 2005). Within this 2-fishery framework, we found that trawling regime, longline fishing time and breeding stage were key factors explaining shearwater attendance to longline vessels, but mainly trawling regime and fishing time increased the incidental capture of Cory's shearwaters. More specifically, during the pre-breeding and chick-rearing periods, bycatch dramatically increased during sunrise sets in the absence of trawling activity. Importantly, this study indicates the need for an integrated multi-fisheries management approach for the conservation of seabirds and highlights the necessity of banning longline fishing during periods of trawling inactivity. © Inter-Research 2010.;English;Article;All Open Access, Bronze;Scopus;NA;CS - Mediterranean;>100,000;decade;5,000-10,000;month;Fisheries Dependent Data;NA;Poisson model _ ZIP modelling _ GLMs;1;2;3;NA;Balearic and Catalan Seas constitute only a part of the western Mediterranean Sea.

Using biomass indices obtained from bottom trawl surveys, the most significant elasmobranch species in the continental shelf ecosystem are described. By combining their spatial distribution with multivariate analysis, including other fish species, it is possible to place them within the communities that structure the ecosystem. Considering all the fish species inhabiting the continental shelf and applying a trophodynamic model, which incorporates biomass, production, biological parameters, feeding diets and catches and discards of the fisheries, the trophic level of the main elasmobranch groups and their relationship with others species inhabiting the same area are obtained. Also an estimation of the impact of the different fisheries (gears) that operate in the study area is made.

Fixed nets are a matter of concern for sea turtles mainly in coastal areas during the neritic stage when both juvenile and adult life stages are affected. Mortality caused by entanglement in set nets is related to forced apnoea due to the high soak time of the nets and consequent drowning. This study investigated the loggerhead turtle bycatch in set net coastal fisheries in the northern Adriatic Sea (General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean Geographical Sub-Area 17, [GSA 17]) through an interview-based approach, to understand the potential contribution of these fisheries to the general decline of the sea turtle population. A second goal was to identify a possible hot-spot turtle bycatch area through on-board observations. The study estimates that more than 5400 turtles are caught in the west GSA 17 each year with the largest number in the summer. A hot-spot for entanglement was also identified in an area located south of the River Po delta (41.5–69 m depth) during the summer. Sixty-four turtles were caught over a period of 30 fishing days by either trammel nets and gillnets (0.7 and 0.5 turtle per km of net respectively) and was the greatest number that has been observed anywhere in the Mediterranean. Possible management strategies to reduce bycatch include technical modification to gear setting (such as reducing netting slack and using small meshes), bycatch reducer devices (such as LED UV), and area and seasonal gear restrictions to small-scale fisheries in areas of greatest concern in the northern Adriatic Sea.

In this area, a large concentration of gillnet fishery temporally overlaps periods of the most abundant occurrence of foraging diving birds. The aim of the article is to show how bycatch can impact the population of a diving duck. To assess this, we calculate the Potential Biological Removal (PBR) for the studied Greater Scaup population and we model the population change according to age-structured matrix models. Summing all the available recent figures on Greater Scaup bycatch in north-west Europe yields an estimated mean annual total of 3,991 individuals (2% of the flyway population). For a baseline stable population, an age-structured matrix model indicates that at this bycatch level the Greater Scaup population that winters in north-west Europe will decrease by 36% over the next 30 years, qualifying the status of the population as 'Vulnerable' according to IUCN criteria. As this population also experiences decline prior to bycatch, this decrease will be 57%, which qualifies the status as 'Endangered'. PBR as an indicator of population vitality does not work in our case because the PBR-informed allowable bycatch values have a significantly negative impact on the population. Our results indicate unambiguously that fishery bycatch is among the most important threats responsible for the Greater Scaup's decline. While recent data suggest that some improvement has taken place in the species' status over the last 10 years, measures to protect Greater Scaup from bycatch are required.

Trammel nets, in particular, have key advantages such as their ease of use and handling and high capture efficiency for numerous commercial species. However, they entail high discard rates (5–44% of the total catch) connected to high mortality, thus exerting an adverse impact on benthic communities, besides catching individuals of commercial species under the minimum conservation reference size (MCRS) and specimens of protected species. Fish pots are seen as alternative and a more sustainable gear type that allow reducing discards in SSFs. In this study, a collapsible pot was tested at three coastal sites in the north-western Adriatic Sea (GFCM GSA 17) to compare its catch efficiency with that of the local traditional trammel nets. Data analysis demonstrated a similar catch efficiency for the commercial species, both among sites and as a whole. Moreover, the trammel net caught a larger amount of discards, both in terms of species number and of CPUEW. The catch comparison study involved the two most abundant landed species, common cuttlefish Sepia officinalis and annular sea bream Diplodus annularis. The pots were more effective for S. officinalis, whereas the trammel net was more effective for the shorter length classes for D. annularis, which were mostly under the MCRS (12 cm). The innovative pots could provide a valuable alternative to the trammel nets traditionally used in the Adriatic Sea, at least in certain areas and periods. Their main advantages include that they do not require a different rigging and they can be used without bait, while their foldable design allows large numbers to be easily loaded on board SSF vessels. The results of this pilot study indicate that pots can achieve the objectives of reducing discards and bycatch in SSFs without penalizing the catch of commercial species.

The present study assesses the potential for ghost fishing in the creel (baited trap) fishery for Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus, one of the most valuable fished species in European waters. Baited creels were deployed and monitored at a shallow and a deep site for 363 and 217 d, respectively. Catch was counted at regular intervals by SCUBA diving at the shallow site and by periodically hauling creels at the deepwater site. Both trials showed that most captured species were able to escape from the creels, with only N. norvegicus being trapped for long periods of time, suggesting that creels are very selective for the target species. Dead target or non-target species within creels appeared to be ineffective at attracting additional N. norvegicus into the creels. It was concluded that, following the initial attraction to creels, once all the bait has been consumed, lost creels will cease to fish. The main reasons for the low ghost fishing performance of N. norvegicus creels may be the design of the creel itself (which allows non-target species to escape relatively easily), the behaviour of N. norvegicus restricting the number of animals entering the creels once the bait has been consumed, and the ability of N. norvegicus to survive for long periods of time once caught. © Inter-Research 2008.;English;Article;All Open Access, Bronze;Scopus;NA;NE-Atlantic;>100,000;year;05/Oct;month;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;And in situ obervation and data collection;CPUE _ Kruskal-Wallis _ 1-way ANOVA;2;2;3;NA;NA;4.5;Fisheries independent survey;Benthos;Benthic_epifauna;Other;Mud;Nephrops novegicus _ Carcinus maenas _ Liocarcinus depurator _ Cancer pagurus _ Asterias rubens;Input of litter;NA;gear selectivity (without escape gap);NA;Commercial;Pots;NA;NA;Number of selected species caught per creel;Abundance/biomass/density;Positive;The maximum number of individuals per;

Here we assess the spatial and temporal variability in abundance, diversity and community structure of the suprabenthic peracarid assemblages in this region and examine this variability in relation to the natural and anthropogenic (trawling fisheries) disturbance regimes. The sampling was conducted between March 2003 and May 2004 in three main fishing grounds, the canyon head (average depth: 490 m), the canyon wall (average depth: 550 m) and the eastern adjacent slope (average depth: 820 m), as well as in two non-exploited areas in the western (at 900 m depth) and eastern (at 1500 m depth) slope near the canyon mouth. A total of 138 species were identified, with amphipods being the most speciose and abundant group, followed by mysids in terms of abundance. Our results show high spatial and temporal variability in suprabenthic assemblages. Densities were higher in the canyon head and western slope, which appear to be the preferential routes for water masses and particle fluxes in months of flood events, and other energetic processes. In the canyon head, where periodic erosion processes are more active, low diversity, high dominance and higher turnover (ß-diversity) were observed, apparently coupled with significant temporal fluctuations in the densities of the highly motile component of suprabenthos (mysids, predatory and scavenging amphipods). In the sedimentary more stable eastern slope, high diversity values were observed, accompanied by a higher relative contribution of the less motile groups (i.e. amphipods, most isopods, cumaceans). These groups have a closer interaction with the sediment where they exploit different food sources and are more susceptible to physical disturbance. Temporal variability in their diversity may be related to changes in food quality rather than quantity. In the canyon wall, temporal fluctuations in diversity indices were only revealed in relation to the overall higher and more continued fishing pressure observed in the canyon wall fishing ground (Cara Norte/Sot site). Here, species richness and abundance declined with increasing fishing pressure but the lowest trophic and taxonomic diversities were observed under intermediate levels of disturbance.

Densities were higher in the canyon head and western slope, which appear to be the preferential routes for water masses and particle fluxes in months of flood events, and other energetic processes. In the canyon head, where periodic erosion processes are more active, low diversity, high dominance and higher turnover (ß-diversity) were observed, apparently coupled with significant temporal fluctuations in the densities of the highly motile component of suprabenthos (mysids, predatory and scavenging amphipods). In the sedimentary more stable eastern slope, high diversity values were observed, accompanied by a higher relative contribution of the less motile groups (i.e. amphipods, most isopods, cumaceans). These groups have a closer interaction with the sediment where they exploit different food sources and are more susceptible to physical disturbance. Temporal variability in their diversity may be related to changes in food quality rather than quantity. In the canyon wall, temporal fluctuations in diversity indices were only revealed in relation to the overall higher and more continued fishing pressure observed in the canyon wall fishing ground (Cara Norte/Sot site). Here, species richness and abundance declined with increasing fishing pressure but the lowest trophic and taxonomic diversities were observed under intermediate levels of disturbance. These findings underline (i) the differences between relatively low and highly motile taxa in terms of response to disturbance events;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Health status of the coral habitat (degree of physical impact, % cover of living tissue, colony size), occurrence of trawl marks and lost fishing gear, height of coral colonies and associated fauna were analysed from 44 video-lines. Fishing impact was more frequent on the offshore reefs (36.5% of the observed areas) than those in the coastal reefs (0.6%). The most visible effects of fishing were broken and displaced coral colonies. At some sites only small scattered fragments of live corals were observed, indicating recent impact. The mean colony height of Lophelia and gorgonian corals at impacted sites was around half the size of those at non-impacted sites. Both species richness and abundance was higher at non-impacted coral habitats compared to impacted. The actinarian Protanthea simplex and unidentified brittlestars were the only taxa with higher abundance on impacted compared with non-impacted habitats. The reefs at the offshore location were protected against bottom trawling in 2009 through the establishment of a marine protected area (MPA), but a general ban against trawling on known coral reefs had already been implemented in 1999. In the MPA, signs of regrowth were observed. Most of the observed damage probably occurred over 10 years earlier. Results show that live and non-impacted cold water coral reefs have an important ecological function by enhancing the local biodiversity and fish abundance.

As ectotherms are generally smaller and grow faster with increasing temperature, they may be less vulnerable to trawling and quicker to replenish biomass in warmer waters. Therefore, the chronic effect of bottom trawling on benthic invertebrate biomass may depend on local sea temperature and, hence, be under the influence of climate change. We tested this hypothesis using benthic grab samples from 200 sites spanning the North Sea and data on trawling pressure in the areas where samples were collected. The relationship between benthic community biomass and swept area ratio (the average number of times the seabed is trawled per year) was negative where annual bottom water temperature was low (8°C), positive in relatively warm water (11°C) and approximately neutral at intermediate temperature (9.5°C). These relationships were attributed to changes in mean body mass, not community abundance. Our results are consistent with theoretical expectations and suggest that climate modulates the chronic effect of bottom trawling on benthic invertebrate biomass. Confirming causality and determining the broader consequences for community structure and ecosystem functioning should be priorities of future research. © 2020 Crown copyright 2020.;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;CS - North Sea;>100,000;year;50,000-100,000;day;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;Van veen grabs;GAMs _ Wald test;2;2;3;Fisheries and climate change are recognised as priorities for marine conservation and management.

The relationship was negative in cold water (8degrees centigrade), approximately neutral in intermediate temperature (9.5degrees centigrade) and positive in warm water (11degrees centigrade). Changes in community biomass with trawling pressure were greatest at low levels of trawl disturbance. The relationship between community abundance, trawling pressure and bottom water temperature was not significant. There was however, a significant relationship between mean body mass and trawling pressure. That is, increasing trawling pressure was associated with an increase in mean body mass in warm water and a decrease in mean body mass in cold water, with changes most pronounced when trawling pressure was low.

Both midwater and bottom trawling are commonplace, including on deep canyon channel floors. Bottom trawling is identified here as a possible cause of changes to seafloor roughness along the canyon interfluves. An Arc Chord Ratio (ACR) rugosity index is calculated for the Whittard area and correlated with Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) data using various statistical models. Over higher slopes or rougher ground the heavily fished locations show a more homogeneous rugosity distribution than those lightly fished, indicating possible smoothing of the seabed. Bottom trawling activity on adjacent interfluves/shelf is known to generate energetic turbid, sediment plumes within the canyon branches to 2500 m depth, with elevated Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) concentrations in the water column up to 400 m above the seabed. Lipid biomarker analysis of organic material collected from these plumes showed higher concentrations of total lipids at sites that are intensively trawled (east). In comparison to sites that are less intensively trawled (west), higher contributions of fatty alcohols were detected. While lower concentrations of unsaturated fatty acids were detected, biomarkers indicative of phytoplankton accounted for 93.4 ± 0.7% of total lipids identified from eastern samples suggesting rapid transport of labile compounds. Results presented here suggest that intensive trawling induced changes to sediment transport will complicate the interpretation of biogeochemical property distributions at canyon systems, particularly from single surveys.

One site was located in a heavily exploited fishing ground. The second site was enclosed in the fishing ground but had not been trawled in twenty years. The third site was located adjacent to a marine protected area and was subjected to occasional trawling. The fourth site was located inside the marine protected area, where trawling was banned thirty years ago. Side-scan sonar records of trawl marks on the seabed confirmed the gradient of trawling intensity.

The third site was located adjacent to a marine protected area and was subjected to occasional trawling. The fourth site was located inside the marine protected area, where trawling was banned thirty years ago.

A proposed method for assessing the extent of the seabed significantly affected by demersal fishing in the Greater North Sea. - ICES Journal of Marine Science, 70: 1085-1096.The widespread impact of bottom towed fishing gear on benthic species and communities has long been recognized. The responses to a given intensity of fishing disturbance can be influenced by the extent to which these species and communities are preconditioned to disturbance by natural processes, in particular waves and currents. The advent of vessel monitoring system (VMS) and models of natural disturbance enable high-resolution and large-scale comparisons of fishing and natural disturbance. VMS data were employed to estimate the trawled area per 12 km by 12 km grid cell. We then quantified natural disturbance by estimating the number of days in a year the seabed was disturbed by tides and waves. As natural disturbance acts on large spatial scales, we assumed that each natural disturbance event affects whole grid cells. Frequencies could thus be translated into an area of impact, allowing us to compare fishing with natural disturbance. We show how such comparisons can be used to estimate the extent of different seabed substrate types significantly affected by demersal fishing. A measure of the probability that fishing disturbance exceeds natural disturbance provides one metric for identifying areas of significant trawling impact on seabed habitats and might be used to measure progress towards achieving good environmental status for sea-floor integrity within the context of the European Union's Marine Strategy Framework Directive. For more than half the seabed in the English sector of the Greater North Sea, the results suggest that disturbance attributable to demersal fishing exceeds natural disturbance based on data from the years 2006 to 2008. The imbalance between natural and fishing disturbance is greatest in muddy substrates and deep circalittoral habitats. © Crown copyright 2013.;English;Article;All Open Access, Bronze;Scopus;NA;CS - North Sea;>100,000;multidecadal;10,000-50,000;day;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;Proposed modelling method;2;2;3;Our results show that muddy substrate and deep circalittoral habitats are more likely to experience significant fishing impact due to low probabilities of natural disturbance.  These habitats might therefore be more senstive to demersak fishing. deep circalittoral habitats are relatively stable with low natural disturbance levels. As such, these deep circalittoral habitats are more adversely affected by demersal fishing than shallow coastal habitats (Kaiser et al., 2002). As they account for large parts of the continental shelf (44.3% or 68 612 km2), fishing disturbance is expected to exceed natural disturbance in a large proportion  of the GNS, even if absolute levels of fishing disturbance are relatively low.;NA;4.3;Modelling/simulation;Physical_habitats;Mixed;NA;Mixed;Habitat: sediment;Physical disturbance of the seabed;NA;Demersal fishing disturbance;natural disturbance;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;NA;NA;Various types of seabed substrate disturbance;Other;Multiple;The probability of natural disrubance being greater than that of fishing disturbance is spatially variable across the GNS. ;MacMillan

Evaluating the effects of these pressures is often restricted to contemporary benthic data, limiting the potential to observe change from an earlier (preimpact) state. In this study, we compared benthic species records from 1884 to 1886 by CGJ Petersen with recent data to investigate how benthic invertebrate species in the eastern Kattegat have changed since preimpact time. The study shows that species turnover between old and recent times was high, ca. 50%, and the species richness in the investigation area was either unchanged or higher in recent times, suggesting no net loss of species. Elements of metacommunity structure analysis of datasets from the 1880s, 1990s, and 2000s revealed a clear change in the depth distribution structure since the 1880s. The system changed from a Quasi-nested/Random pattern unrelated to depth in the 1880s with many species depth ranges over a major part of the studied depth interval, to a Clementsian pattern in recent times strongly positively correlated with depth. Around 30% of the 117 species recorded both in old and in recent times, including most trawling-sensitive species, that is large, semiemergent species, showed a decrease in maximal depth of occurrence from the deeper zone fished today to the shallower unfished zone, with on average 20 m. Concurrently, the species category remaining in the fished zone was dominated by species less sensitive to bottom trawling like infauna polychaetes and small-sized Peracarida crustaceans, most likely with short longevity. The depth interval and magnitude of the changes in depth distribution and the changes in species composition indicate impacts from bottom trawling rather than eutrophication. Furthermore, the high similarity of results from the recent datasets 10 years apart suggests chronic impact keeping the system in an altered state. © 2018 The Authors.

Many species, including the species likely to suffer most from intensive trawling, have narrower depth distribution intervals in recent times with changed maximal depth limits abive and away from the fished zone. Our study using a temporal preimpact reference underpins earlier suggestions that chronic fishing disturbance has changed benthic community structure over wide areas of the shelf seas. ;4.3;Fisheries independent survey;Benthos;NA;NA;Mixed;Decapoda _ Bivalvia _ Echinodermata _ Gastrapoda _ Polychaeta _ Peracarida;Physical disturbance of the seabed;NA;Bottom trawling intensity;Eutropication ;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;Otter trawl;NA;species and trait composition;Community composition;Negative;The decreases in maximal depth away from the fished zone, and the different species and trait composition of decreasing and species are as argued above, are most easily explained by benthic trawling impacts in recent times. Concurrently, richness in the investigation area corrected for sampling effort did not decrease, and therefore, it seems that the major effect of trawling is changes in spatial distribution of species within the area rather than net species loss. ;MacMillan

Females were further examined and classified based on their maturity stage and the size at onset of sexual maturity was estimated by Probit analysis. Temporal differences in mean CL were detected for both sexes, with a tendency of lower values each year, along with a respective increase in Fishing Mortality and Exploitation Rate, indicating the effects of fishing pressure over the population. Size at onset of sexual maturity was estimated at 32.6 mm, higher than the official mesh sizes for creels (28 mm) and gillnets (26 mm).

However, the ability to detect these impacts over large spatial scales can be obscured by various complicating factors, such as community adaptation to disturbance and co-varying environmental conditions. An ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management therefore requires ecological indicators which can ‘disentangle’ trawling effects from other natural and human drivers, and respond effectively to shifts in ecological quality. We collected benthic macrofaunal samples at 21 sites across a Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus fishing ground in the Kattegat, and separated the benthic community into small (1–4 mm) and large (>4 mm) size fractions. Four taxonomic indicators (total density, species density, Shannon diversity, and biomass) and four functional indicators (functional diversity, functional richness, functional evenness, and functional dispersion) were calculated based on each size fraction, and the two fractions combined (pooled community). Here, we compare the ability of these indicators to detect trawling impacts across size categories. We show that indicators derived from large macrofauna were highly effective in this regard, and were less influenced by other environmental drivers, such as depth, sediment grain size, bottom current velocity, salinity, and temperature. This suggests that the taxonomic and functional characteristics of benthic communities display a size-dependent sensitivity to trawling disturbance, and therefore community metrics based on large benthic macrofauna may provide useful indicators. By contrast, indicators derived from the small fraction performed poorly, and those based on the pooled community demonstrated a varied ability to detect trawling. Small macrofauna are typically characterised by high density, diversity, and population growth rates, and their relative resilience to trawling may mask the response of the more sensitive macrofauna. This highlights an underlying issue with calculating indicators based on the whole benthic community. The approach outline here is easily applied, improves indicator performance, and has the potential to reduce laboratory workloads due to the fewer taxa and individuals required for analyses. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd;English;Article;All Open Access, Green;Scopus;NA;Baltic Sea - non CS;>100,000;two week;10,000-50,000;snapshot/no repeat sampling;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;GLMMs;2;2;2;NA;NA;4.3;Fisheries independent survey;Benthos;NA;NA;Mixed;Ophiuroidea _ Phoronida _ Bilvalvia _ Polychaeta _ Gastropoda _ Echinodermata _ Neophrop nervegicus;Physical disturbance of the seabed;NA;Increased trawling intensity / disturbance;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;Otter trawl;NA;Macrofaunal indicators (inc. density, biomass, functional richness, Shannon diversity, functional diversity);Abundance/biomass/density;Negative;Not statistically significant;MacMillan

Sediment cores were taken on the track and compared to undisturbed controls. Benthic fluxes were immediately affected and an upward shift in pore water DIC profiles was detected. The time needed for the sediment to readjust to a new biogeochemical state seemed to be nutrient-specific. Sediment properties (profiles of chlorophyll, organic carbon and water content) were found to change significantly. Macrofauna was removed completely by the dredge pointing out the potential loss of highly valuable functions that are associated with them. In the Baltic Sea, in areas which were previously the most heavily fished, the frequency of trawling may have left little time for readjustment and potentially kept the seabed in a permanent state of transient biogeochemical cycling. © 2021 The Authors;English;Article;All Open Access, Hybrid Gold;Scopus;NA;CS - Baltic Sea;0-5;day;0-5;day;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;2-way repeated measures ANOVA _ ANOVA;2;2;3;NA;This controlled bottom trawling field experiment using a benthic;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The degree of impact on both benthic communities and demersal species depends on the fishing effort level. This may vary over the year because of the fleet dynamics, which are in turn normally driven by the main target species' life cycle. In this study we describe changes in benthic functional components of a northwestern Mediterranean fishing ground that represents a recruitment area for an important target species (red mullet, Mullus barbatus). This fishing ground experiences a varying intensity of fishing effort over the year and benthic functional components under different levels of trawling were compared with an unfished, control area. Traits related to sexual maturity and life span for infauna and body size and life span for epifauna were found to vary with fishing activity. Potential effects of these changes on ecological functioning and the impact on red mullet population are discussed.

To simulate lost nets, 27 fleets of tangle nets were deployed on soft bottoms in the Cantabrian Sea shelf at depths between 117 and 135 m. Nets were recovered at intervals of 1-12 months and their catches recorded (composition, abundance, size, biomass, preservation state) in two trials, measuring seasonal changes in catch rates. A fleet of tangle nets was operated following commercial procedures next to the abandoned nets, providing simultaneous estimates of commercial catch rates. Monkfish (Lophius budegassa and Lophius piscatorius) dominated the fish catches in abandoned tangle nets (81%). In summer-fall conditions, abandoned nets showed after 135 days catch rates similar to those simultaneously recorded for commercial nets (respectively, 0.18 and 0.22 specimens per 100 m of netting), but ceased to capture monkfish after 224 days. In spring-summer conditions, monkfish catches were negligible in abandoned experimental nets and lower in the commercial nets than in the previous trial. The pattern of extended catch rates observed in tangle nets abandoned in deep water differed from studies using abandoned gill and trammel nets in shallow waters, which typically cease to capture fish much sooner. Total monkfish catches by abandoned tangle nets were estimated through a cumulative catch model to be 17.7 kg (4.7 specimens) per 100 m of netting. Multiplying this value by the estimated number of tangle nets lost annually by the Cantabrian Sea fishing fleet, it was estimated that 18.11 of monkfish are captured annually by abandoned nets. This represents 1. 46% of the commercial landings of these species in the Cantabrian Sea. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Commercial trawling is the most recurrent and pervasive of human impacts on the deep-sea floor, but studies on its consequences on the biogeochemistry of deep-sea sediments are still scarce. Pigments, fatty acids, amino acids and carbohydrates were analysed in sediments from the flanks of the La Fonera (Palamós) submarine canyon (NW Mediterranean Sea), where a commercial bottom trawling fishery has been active for more than 70 yr. More specifically, we investigated how trawling-induced sediment reworking affects the quality of sedimentary organic matter which reaches the seafloor and accumulates in the sediment column, which is fundamental for the development of benthic communities. Sediment samples were collected during two oceanographic cruises in spring and autumn 2011. The sampled sites included trawl fishing grounds as well as pristine (control) areas. We report that bottom trawling in the flanks of the La Fonera Canyon has caused an alteration of the quality of the organic matter accumulated in the upper 5 cm of the seafloor. The use of a wide pool of biochemical tracers characterized by different reactivity to degradation allowed for us to discriminate the long-term effects of trawl-induced sediment reworking from the natural variability caused by the seasonal cycle of production and sinking of biogenic particles. Differences between untrawled and trawled areas were evidenced by labile amino acids, while differences between spring and autumn samples were detected only by the more labile indicators chlorophyll <i>a</i> and monounsaturated fatty acids. These results suggest that changes in the biochemical composition of the sedimentary organic matter caused by bottom trawling can be more relevant than those associated with natural seasonality and pose serious concerns about the ecological sustainability of deep-sea trawling activities. © Author(s) 2013.;English;Article;All Open Access, Gold, Green;Scopus;NA;Mediterranean - non CS;10,000-50,000;half year;5,000-10,000;quarter;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;Oceanographic cruises;2-way ANOVA _ 1-way ANOVA;2;2;3;NA;By removing bioturbators and at the same;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In general, the number of species, number of individuals and weight increase when the soft bottom is colonized by the alga, but the catch of valuable fish, and consequently the fishermen's income, decrease. The spreading of the alga is facilitated by fishing activity, in particular by bottom trawlers and trammel nets. Fishermen are themselves strongly affected by the spreading, not only because of the decrease in valuable fish, but also because the massive presence of the alga interferes with the use of the gear. © 2000 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.;English;Conference Paper;All Open Access, Bronze;Scopus;NA;Mediterranean - non CS;1,000-5,000;five year;100-500;quarter;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;Wilcoxon tests ;2;2;2;NA;NA;4.3;Fisheries independent survey;Benthos;Benthic_epifauna;Other;Mixed;Caulerpa taxifolia _ Cymodocea nodosa;Physical disturbance of the seabed;NA;Bottom fishing gear;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;NA;Trammel net _ 200m long _ 3m high _ bottom otter trawls;alga distribution;Abundance/biomass/density;Positive;We argue that fishing activity and fishing gear are the;

This study evaluates how these effects can influence marine ecological functioning by assessing their consequences on benthic pelagic coupling. Experiments were conducted on sediment microcosms taken from 9 North Sea and 2 Eastern Scheldt locations. Samples were subjected to physical disturbances by mechanically stirring the sediment surface or electrical stimulation with exposure to high frequency pulsed bipolar or direct currents. Electrical exposure times of 3 and 120-s were used to simulate in situ exposure times related to sole (Solea solea) and razor clam (Ensis spp.) electric fisheries respectively. Water column oxygen rapidly declined after sediment resuspension, inducing an immediate uptake ranging from 0.55 to 22 mmol oxygen per m-2 of sediment disturbed. Mechanical disturbances released the equivalent of up to 94 and 101 h of natural ammonium and silicate effluxes respectively. Fresh organic material significantly predicted the magnitude of mechanical-induced oxygen, ammonium, phosphate and silicate changes. No biogeochemical effects from bipolar (3 s or 120 s) or 3-s direct current exposures were detected. However, significant changes were induced by 120-s exposures to direct currents due to electrolysis and ionic drift. This lowered the water column pH by 1–1.3 units and caused the appearance of iron oxides on the sediment surface, resulting in the equivalent of 25–28 h of sedimentary phosphate removal. Our findings demonstrate that prolonged (+1 min) exposure to high frequency pulsed direct currents can cause electrochemical effects in the marine environment, with implications for phosphorus cycling. Nevertheless, bi-directional pulsed currents used in flatfish pulse trawling and AC waveforms featured in Ensis electrofishing, seem to severely limit these effects. Mechanical disturbance, on the other hand, causes a much greater effect on benthic pelagic coupling, the extent of which depends on sediment grain size, organic matter content, and the time of the year when the impact occurs. © 2021;English;Article;All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green;Scopus;NA;CS - North Sea;>100,000;year;>100,000;week;Other;Independent electro trawls sediment cores;Linear Mixed Models (LMM) _ 1-way ANOVA;2;2;3;NA;NA;4.3;Fisheries independent survey;Benthos;NA;NA;Mixed;Fishery for (but not testing any effect on) Solea solea _  Ensis spp. ;Electromagnetic input;NA;Pulsed bipolar currents;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;NA;NA;pH and solute concentrations;Other;No impact;This study did not find any consistent biogeochemical effects concerning the pulsed bipolar currents used by the electrotrawling fishery for North Sea sole or for Ensis electrofishing using alternating currents.;MacMillan

The MAREANO programme (Marine Areal Database for Norwegian Coasts and Sea Areas) conducts seabed mapping in order to fill knowledge gaps in relation to the implementation of management plans for the Norwegian EEZ. This paper describes the experience from the mapping strategy used by MAREANO. By using a variety of sampling gears the benthic environment and communities from all types of seabed are thoroughly documented. This involves the mapping of bottom topography, seabed substratum, pollutants, species composition, biomass and habitat forming vulnerable biota in a varied marine landscape. The area mapped from 2006 to 2013 is 131,000 km2, spans depths ranging from 40 to 2700 m and covers a variety of topographic features including canyons, cold seeps and coral reefs. The information gained by this broad mapping approach has offered a unique insight into the diversity of benthic species and habitats. Through interpretation and classification of the information gained MAREANO scientists produce a database and detailed maps of seabed surficial geology, marine landscapes, biotopes and particularly sensitive and threatened habitats. Indicators of human impact, such as pollutants, trawl marks and marine litter are also presented on maps. Experience from 8 years of detailed mapping shows the necessity of thorough mapping for informed management decision-making. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.;English;Review;All Open Access, Bronze;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4.3;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;MacMillan

However, increasing human activities within estuaries and surrounding areas lead to significant habitat quality degradation for the juveniles. In recent years, plastic pollution has become a global environmental issue as plastic debris are found in all aquatic environments with potential adverse impacts on marine biota. Given the important ecological role of estuaries and implications of microplastics (MP) in ecosystems, here we assess the occurrence, number, size, and polymer types of MP ingested by wild and caged juvenile European flounder (Platichthys flesus). We deployed caged fish for 1 month at five sites in three estuaries in the eastern English Channel. The Seine estuary, heavily impacted by manmade modifications and one of the most contaminated estuaries in Europe, was compared to two smaller estuaries (Canche and Liane) less impacted by industrial activities. We found that juvenile flounders (7–9 cm) were vulnerable to plastic ingestion. Seventy-five percent of caged fish and 58% of wild caught fish had the presence of MP items in their digestive tract. Fibers (69%) dominated in the fish’s digestive tract at all sites. An average of 2.04 ± 1.93 MP items were ingested by feral juvenile flounder and 1.67 ± 1.43 by caged juvenile flounder. For the caged fish, the three sites impacted by wastewater treatment plant (Liane, Le Havre harbor, and Rouen) were those with the highest percentage of individuals that has ingested MP items. Most of the isolated items were fibers and blue in color. Polymers identified by micro Raman spectroscopy were polycaprolactam, polyethylene terephthalate, and polyurethane. Although other environmental factors may have affected caged fish condition and mortality, we found no significant correlation with the number of ingested MP. However, the high occurrence of MP ingested by juvenile fish on nursery grounds raises concerns on their potential negative effects for fish recruitment success and population renewal. Finally, this study describes, for the first time, the feasibility of using caged juvenile fish as an assessing tool of MP contamination in estuarine nursery grounds. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.;English;Article;All Open Access, Green;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4.5;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;MacMillan

The present study in the East Mingulay Special Area of Conservation (a Marine Protected Area in the Sea of the Hebrides, western Scotland) used historic surveys and benthic samples to obtain baseline levels of anthropogenic debris and microparticle ingestion. Most debris identified in the MPA was fisheries-related. A total of 11% of benthic macrofauna from Mingulay Reef Area 1 and Banana Reef had ingested microplastics, with no statistically significant effect of feeding guild, station, or reef, on ingestion rates. However, the ingestion rate was highest at a station located in a topographic hollow along a gentle sloping area with strong variable ocean currents where fine-scale interactions between bathymetry and hydrography may have helped trap and focus microparticles. Raman spectroscopy of microparticles revealed several types of polymers being ingested, tentatively identified as polypropylene (PP), polyurethane (PU), polystyrene (PS), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Besides establishing a baseline assessment of marine litter and microparticles in a deep-water setting, the approach demonstrates the utility of using historic data and specimens collected for other purposes to expand the geographic and ecosystem coverage for larger more regional-scale and even basin-wide assessments such as those needed to inform Good Environmental Status in European waters, as called for by the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. © 2019 La Beur, Henry, Kazanidis, Hennige, McDonald, Shaver and Roberts.;English;Article;All Open Access, Gold, Green;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NE-Atlantic;10,000-50,000;decade;1,000-5,000;year;Visual Analyses of Quadrats/Transects;Underwater camera and ROV, also one year Van veen grab from 2003, Raman spectroscopy;Chi-squared analyses;NA;NA;NA;NA;This investigation showed that most debris was lost fishing gear. ;4.5;Field experiment;Benthos;NA;NA;Unknown;NA;Input of litter;NA;microparticle ingestion;NA;Unknown;NA;NA;NA;Feeding guild, reef station and reefs;Abundance/biomass/density;Multiple;Although number of ingestest particles clearly differed between feeding guilds, stations and between the two reefs, none of these differences were statistically significant. ;MacMillan

We present an overview of the distribution of seabed litter and bottom trawling in Norwegian waters (the Norwegian Sea and the southern Barents Sea). Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) records and trawl marks (TM) on the seabed were used as indicators of pressure and impact of bottom trawling, respectively. Estimates of TM density and litter abundance were based on analyses of seabed videos from 1,778 locations, surveyed during 23 cruises, part of the Norwegian seabed mapping programme MAREANO. The abundance and composition of litter and the density of TM varied with depth, and type of sediments and marine landscapes. Lost or discarded fishing gear (especially lines and nets), and plastics (soft and hard plastic and rubber) were the dominant types of litter. The distribution of litter reflected the distribution of fishing intensity (density of VMS records) and density of TM at a regional scale, with highest abundance close to the coast and in areas with high fishing intensity, indicated from the VMS data. However, at a local scale patterns were less clear. An explanation to this could be that litter is transported with currents and accumulates in troughs, canyons, and local depressions, rather than reflecting the fisheries footprints directly. Also, deliberate dumping of discarded fishing gear is likely to occur away from good fishing grounds. Extreme abundance of litter, observed close to the coast is probably caused by such discarded fishing gear, but the contribution from aggregated populations on land is also indicated from the types of litter observed. The density of trawl marks is a good indicator of physical impact in soft sediments where the trawl gear leaves clear traces, whereas on harder substrates the impacts on organisms is probably greater than indicated by the hardly visible marks. The effects of litter on benthic communities is poorly known, but large litter items, such as lost fishing gear may add to the direct negative effects of bottom trawling. © 2018 Buhl-Mortensen and Buhl-Mortensen.;English;Article;All Open Access, Gold, Green;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;Norwegian Sea;5,000-10,000;decade;1,000-5,000;quarter;NA;NA;Pearson product-moment correlation;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4.3 _ 4.5;Field experiment;Benthos;Benthic_epifauna;Other;Mixed;NA;Physical disturbance of the seabed;NA;Number of litter items_Trawl mark density_fishing intensity ;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;NA;NA;NA;Abundance/biomass/density;NA;NA;MacMillan

Trawling effect may be dependent on the spatial and temporal distribution of abrasion, the habitat type including natural perturbation intensity and the fishing gear used. Nonetheless, there is an urgent need to identify or develop indices likely to measure the effect of trawling. For this purpose benthic fauna by-catch monitored in scientific trawl surveys carried out in all European waters in the frame of the Common Fishery Policy Data Collection Multiannual Program may be used. Benthic invertebrates data used in this study were collected during scientific bottom trawl surveys covering the English Channel, the North Sea and the North-West Mediterranean. Swept area ratios derived from VMS data were used to quantify the intensity of fishery induced abrasion on the seabed. Fifteen indices were investigated: taxonomic diversity metrics, functional diversity indices and functional indices, the two later based on sensitivity traits to physical abrasion. Their properties, such as their capacity to detect trawling effect, their statistical behavior or their ability to inform on community structure, were investigated. Among them, fours indices specific to fishery effect detection based on biological traits appeared to be the best performing benthic indices regarding these requirements: Trawling Disturbance Index (TDI), modified-Trawling Disturbance Index (mTDI), partial-Trawling Disturbance Index (pTDI), modified sensitivity index (mT). Maps of the distribution pattern of seabed sensitivity captured through each of these four indices were produced. This work has highlighted the need to use specific indices to monitor the effect of trawling on benthic communities but also that the use of different indices may be necessary to carry out this monitoring in all European waters. © 2020;English;Article;All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;scientific trawl survey;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4.3;NA;Benthos;Benthic_epifauna;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;MacMillan

Up to now, studies on gorgonian ecology in the Mediterranean Sea have been focused mainly on the SCUBA diving depth range. Although increased availability of remotely operated vehicles allowed access to the deeper areas, gorgonian assemblages located on continental shelf and slopes are still barely known. Gorgonian assemblages on continental shelves are extremely vulnerable to anthropogenic impacts, especially bottom trawling and longline fishing. To implement effective management and conservation policies it is crucial to understand patterns of genetic structure among populations since connectivity enhances the resilience of populations. Paramuricea macrospina is a key structuring gorgonian in the Menorca Channel's (Balearic Archipelago) outer continental shelf where it covers vast extensions, reaching very high densities. Combining two mitochondrial makers and 10 microsatellites, this study gives the first insight into the genetic diversity and population structure of P. macrospina between 60 and 100 m depth in the Menorca Channel and at a horizontal spatial scale of about 60 Km. Overall, we demonstrate a low genetic diversity and a lack of genetic structure among populations, which may be explained by the geomorphology and hydrodynamic features of the Menorca Channel (e.g. internal waves, high currents). Our study suggests some connectivity among P. macrospina populations in accordance with the high recruitment rates observed. This connectivity may increase the resilience and foster the recovery of impacted populations since the study area will become a Marine Protected Area of the Natura 2000 network in the near future. Nevertheless, complementary studies based on a larger sample size should be conducted to complement our results. In addition, temporal genetic monitoring of these populations should be envisaged to monitor the potential reduction of genetic diversity of this mesophotic species. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd;English;Article;All Open Access, Green;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4.3;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;MacMillan

This negative trend has been particularly severe along the Mediterranean coast of Spain, where most clam stocks have collapsed in the last decades. Management responses to reconcile declining fisheries typically include closing areas to fishing. This study evaluated the effect of fishing closure on the Callista chione bed on the Maresme coast, which was among the most productive fishing grounds. At the same time, this study examined the direct impact of mechanized clam dredges on the megabenthic assemblages. The same locations were surveyed in 2005 (regular fishing activity) and 2020 (5 years after the official fishing closure). The closure of the clam fishing area has not helped in the recovery of the C. chione stock. Changes in C. chione biology and population dynamics were found. However, the diversity in the macrobenthic community has increased. Species with fragile shells or vermiform soft bodies have become more abundant or have appeared. These species are also among those most affected by mechanized clam dredging activity. The data suggest that active management actions are required (e.g. restocking) to recover the C. chione population in the medium term. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;Mediterranean - non CS;5,000-10,000;day;500-1,000;snapshot/no repeat sampling;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;survey to investigate the direct clam fishing effects (through damage);univariate statistics;2;2;3;The closure of the clam fishing area has not helped in the recovery of the C. chione stock (15 yrs after the ban).

The benthic data collected by scientific trawl surveys in all European waters, in the frame of the Common Fishery Policy Data Collection Multiannual Program, can be used to study the impact of large-scale fisheries such as trawling. However, the catchability of trawls is very dependent on the nature of the seabed as well as resulting ground-gear adaptations. Due to its non-destructive nature and its ability to focus on benthic macro-epifauna, towed video sampling appears to be a good alternative to monitor the impact of trawling on benthic communities. In the present work, we studied the influence of fishery induced seabed abrasion and video characteristics on nine indices, which can be used to monitor the effect of trawling on benthic communities, was studied. Among them, three indices specific to fishery effect detection based on biological traits appeared to be the best performing benthic indices with video data: modified-Trawling Disturbance Index, partial-Trawling Disturbance Index, and modified sensitivity index. The effectiveness of these indices to monitor the effect of trawling was evaluated and compared between trawl and video sampling. This work has highlighted that video sampling could be a good alternative, or at least a complementary method, to scientific trawling to monitor the effect of trawling on benthic communities in European waters. © 2021 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2021.;English;Article;;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4.3;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Papadopoulou

Part 2: How much of seabed habitats are left in good environmental status by fisheries?;2020;Ecological Indicators;117;;;;10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106617;;By relating observed changes to the pressures suffered, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive intends to better control the factors of environmental degradation and to manage their consequences in European waters. Several descriptors are defined within the framework of the MFSD and in particular descriptor 1 relating to the biological diversity of the seabed and descriptor 6 relating to the seabed integrity (i.e. the quality of their structures and functions). For each descriptor, indicators and threshold values must be defined and a novel conceptual approach to define and detect seabed integrity thresholds is proposed here. Bottom trawling being the main source of shelf continental disturbance, it is important to evaluate its impact on benthic habitat. The goal of this study is to propose a methodology to determine “Good Ecological Status” threshold values for each habitat type present in three contrasted MFSD sub-region (North Sea, English Channel and Mediterranean Sea). Trawling impacts are dependent of the spatial and temporal distribution of the fishing effort, fishing gears, intensity of natural disturbances and habitat types. Benthic community structures present in these areas were studied using by-catch non-commercial benthic invertebrates data collected during French scientific bottom trawl surveys. Swept area ratios derived from VMS data were used to quantify the intensity of fishery induced abrasion on the seabed. A modeling approach was used to determine abrasion threshold values on each EUNIS level 4 habitat. The values, beyond which trawling has an adverse effect on benthic communities, have been determined for each habitat. This made it possible to assess and map the ecological status of each of the habitats and to determine the percentage of each habitat impacted by trawling. The method proposed here to evaluate the impact of trawling on benthic communities highlighted that the vast majority of the investigated sub-regions were adversely impacted or lost as a result of seabed impacting trawling. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd;English;Article;All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4.3;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Papadopoulou

We provide a method to estimate the sensitivity of benthic habitats based on the longevity composition of the invertebrate community. We hypothesize that long-lived species are more sensitive to trawling mortality due to their lower pace of life (i.e., slower growth, late maturation). We analyze data from box-core and grab samples taken from 401 stations in the English Channel and southern North Sea to estimate the habitat-specific longevity composition of the benthic invertebrate community and of specific functional groups (i.e., suspension feeders and bioturbators), and examine how bottom trawling affects the longevity biomass composition. The longevity biomass composition differed between habitats governed by differences in sediment composition (gravel and mud content) and tidal bed-shear stress. The biomass proportion of long-lived species increased with gravel content and decreased with mud content and shear stress. Bioturbators had a higher median longevity than suspension feeders. Trawling, in particular by gears that penetrate the seabed >2 cm, shifted the community toward shorter-lived species. Changes from bottom trawling were highest in habitats with many long-lived species (hence increasing with gravel content, decreasing with mud content). Benthic communities in high shear stress habitats were less affected by bottom trawling. Using these relationships, we predicted the sensitivity of the benthic community from bottom trawling impact at large spatial scale (the North Sea). We derived different benthic sensitivity metrics that provide a basis to estimate indicators of trawling impact on a continuous scale for the total community and specific functional groups. In combination with high resolution data of trawling pressure, our approach can be used to monitor and assess trawling impact and seabed status at the scale of the region or broadscale habitat and to compare the environmental impact of bottom-contacting fishing gears across fisheries. © 2018 The Authors.

The present study compares outputs of a process-driven benthic habitat sensitivity (PDS) model to the structure, composition and distribution of benthic invertebrates in the Eastern English Channel and southern part of the North Sea. Trawl disturbance indicators (TDI) computed from species biological traits and benthic community composition were produced from samples collected with a bottom trawl. The TDI was found to be highly correlated to the PDS further validating the latter’s purpose to identify natural process-driven pattern of sensitivity. PDS was found to reflect an environmental potential that may no longer be fully observable in the field and difference with in situ biological observations could be partially explained by the spatial distribution of fishery pressure on the seafloor. The management implication of these findings are discussed and we suggest that, used in conjunction with TDI approaches, PDS may help monitor management effort by evaluating the difference between the current state and the presumed optimal environmental status of marine benthic habitats. © 2017 Foveau et al.

GIS-analyses of VMS-data from trawling in the Kattegat by both Danish (2005-2009) and Swedish (2007-2009) vessels show that 95% of all trawling occurs below 22 m depth. Most activity takes place on homogeneous benthic habitats with muddy sediment at depths below the halocline and with almost the same salinity across the entire area. Furthermore, the estimate of trawled area demonstrated that the habitats are nearly 100% impacted, and frequencies of trawling beneath 100 m depth can reach 20 events per year. Multi-variate analysis of community composition could not discriminate between lightly trawled and heavily trawled areas. However, a strong habitat selectivity of the trawl activity and inter-correlation between trawl activity and depth-related community structures complicated interpretation of the results.

The factors that best explained the benthic communities’ distribution were depth + salinity.  Thus, there was no significant effect of the magnitude of trawling disturbance in the benthic community assemblages. The trawl intensity gradient also followed the depth gradient, and all 3 factors (depth, salinity and trawl activity) were so closely inter-correlated that it was not possible to sepa- rate the possible effect of the trawl intensity on the benthic communities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

GIS-analyses of VMS-data from trawling in the Kattegat by both Danish (2005-2009) and Swedish (2007-2009) vessels show that 95% of all trawling occurs below 22 m depth. Most activity takes place on homogeneous benthic habitats with muddy sediment at depths below the halocline and with almost the same salinity across the entire area. Furthermore, the estimate of trawled area demonstrated that the habitats are nearly 100% impacted, and frequencies of trawling beneath 100 m depth can reach 20 events per year. Multi-variate analysis of community composition could not discriminate between lightly trawled and heavily trawled areas. However, a strong habitat selectivity of the trawl activity and inter-correlation between trawl activity and depth-related community structures complicated interpretation of the results. Species with biological traits previously categorized as sensitive to physical disturbance showed higher abundance in areas with low trawl activity compared to areas with higher activity. Thus, the Kattegat has been impacted to an extent where areas with reference conditions for certain habitats below 22 m no longer exist.

In the Mediterranean Sea the coral Isidella elongata (Esper, 1788) characterizes a facies of bathyal compact mud substrates between 500 and 1200 m depth. Based on 4 experimental surveys carried out between 1985 and 2008, we obtained quantitative data on the fauna associated with live coral stands. We show that species richness of invertebrates and crustaceans, as well as abundance and biomass of crustaceans, is higher in areas with large stands of the coral. Some commercial fishery species are also more abundant or reach larger sizes in areas with high density of the coral, particularly the red shrimps Aristeus antennatus (Risso, 1816) and Plesionika martia (A. Milne Edwards, 1883).

Many marine ecosystems are currently threatened by fishing activities, such as bottom trawling, gillnets and demersal and pelagic long-lines. Especially vulnerable are areas described as either sensitive habitats or essential fish habitats. Among these we highlight the associations of sessile organisms, such as cold coral reefs, mostly detected on continental slopes, seamounts and on the walls of submarine canyons, and those areas considered as hot spots of diversity and habitat of vulnerable fauna, like cold seeps, hydrothermal vents and submarine canyons. Essential habitats for pelagic species are defined by oceanographic features like productive areas associated with upwelling, and in the Mediterranean the spawning areas and migratory routes of bluefin tuna, swordfish, and albacore are of high conservation interest. We propose that in a context of difficult fisheries management in Mediterranean international waters, or high seas, these vulnerable habitats should be protected through the establishment of a web of Marine Protected Areas coordinated by all the involved countries and controlled by strict surveillance. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.;English;Article;;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4.3;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Papadopoulou

The effect of such activities is a major cause for concern but in the benthic environment few studies exist that date back more than a few decades. Hence understanding long term changes is a challenge. Within this study we utilized a historic benthic dataset and resurveyed an area west of Eddystone reef in the English Channel previously investigated 112 years ago. The aim of the present work was to describe the current benthic community structure and investigate potential differences between 1895 and 2007. For each of the four major phyla investigated (Polychaeta, Crustacea, Mollusca and Echinodermata), multivariate community analysis showed significant differences between the historic and contemporary surveys. Echinoderm diversity showed a clear reduction between 1895 and 2007. The sea urchins Echinus esculentus, Spatangus purpureus, and Psammechinus miliaris and large star-fish Marthasterias glacialis showed reductions in abundance, in some cases being entirely absent from the survey area in 2007. Polychaetes showed a shift from tubiculous species to small errant and predatory species such as Glycera, Nephtys, and Lumbrineris spp. Within the group Mollusca large species such as Pecten maximus and Laevicardium crassum decreased in abundance while small species increased. Crustaceans in 1895 were dominated by crab species which were present in similar abundances in 2007, but, the order Amphipoda appeared to show a significant increase. While some of the differences observed could stem from differences in methodologies between the surveys, in particular increases of small cryptic species, the loss of large conspicuous species was judged to be genuine.

During the last decades, several anthropogenic activities have affected porpoises in the Baltic region. Most notably is bycatch in static fishing gear, such as gill nets, which is the main human-induced cause of death in odontocetes. There is still considerable uncertainty about which factors influence the amount of bycatch. In the present study, we reviewed bycatch data collected from 1987 to 2016 from the southwestern Baltic Sea. There was a significant difference in bycatch due to seasonality and region, and there was a higher bycatch rate in juveniles than in adults. The only abiotic factor associated with bycatch was the lunar cycle, with more animals bycaught during a full moon. These results improve our understanding of which biotic and abiotic factors are associated with bycatch of Baltic harbor porpoises, which can be used to strengthen conservation endeavors such as managing fishing efforts. © 2021 PeerJ Inc..

The geographical distribution and abundance of D. ramea were herein updated, considering a total of 19 records, seven of which have never previously been reported in scientific papers. Between 2010 and 2017, five Remotely Operative Vehicle surveys carried out along the Sicilian coast recorded 89 colonies. No exhaustive data on density and ecology of this species have been published to date. Data for two areas off the north-eastern Sicilian waters (Aeolian Island and Gulf of Patti) are reported, including the species’ bathymetric distribution, abundance, population density, colony morphometry, population size structure and surrounding habitat description. Size structure and density of D. ramea populations were compared with lost fishing gear density. Around the Aeolian Islands, where little lost fishing gear was observed, the D. ramea population was denser compared with the populations at two sites within the Gulf of Patti, where a greater amount of lost fishing gear was observed. The analysis of D. ramea size classes (single corallite, 2–5 polyps, >5 polyps) at different sites showed that impact varied with fishing gear typology: while lines damage the branches of larger colonies, nets can completely remove them. The limited distribution of D. ramea in some areas also makes this species very vulnerable to impacts such as changes in the chemical–physical characteristics and circulation of sea water. Dendrophyllia ramea is classified as ‘Vulnerable’ according to the Mediterranean IUCN Red List, and it is listed in the Barcelona Convention (Annex B).

Concerns exist, however, that benthic invertebrates might be seriously affected by pulse fishing. Even if direct injuries and mortality were limited, changes in behaviour might compromise their survival, with potentially large impacts on food webs. Here, we investigate effects of electrical pulses on locomotion behaviour and 14-days survival of six invertebrate species from four phyla that may encounter pulse fishing gears. Electrical stimulation consisted of a Pulsed Bipolar Current at 200 V m–1, 30 Hz, 0.33 ms pulse width, and 3 s duration. We quantified species-specific behaviours before, during, and after electrical stimulation and compared these to a non-exposed control group. Responses during stimulation varied from no visible effect (echinoderms) to squirming (sea mouse) and retractions (whelk and crustaceans). Within 30 s after stimulation, all animals resumed normal behavioural patterns, without signs of lasting immobilisation. Starfish, serpent star, whelk and sea mouse showed no change in movement patterns after stimulation, whereas flying crab and hermit crab showed significant changes in activity that were indicative of increased shelter behaviour. For none of the species, survival at 14-days after stimulation was negatively affected.

Among the intense anthropic activities, industrial fisheries have caused the alteration of habitats, the reduction of biodiversity and the main fish stocks. The aim of this research, carried out in the Adriatic Sea, was to test a repeatable Marine Spatial Planning framework aimed at enhancing fisheries sustainability through the application of Decision Support Tools and the composition of a catalog of possible measures. The use of these tools proved very useful to identify possible criticalities and facilitate an effective exchange with fisheries stakeholders, local authorities, and fishermen, whose involvement was an indispensable step in the process. Tool-based analyses allowed to assess the spatial footprint of a range of anthropogenic pressures from human activities (e.g., fisheries, maritime traffic, and aquaculture). Within this multi-pressure scenario, special attention was paid to fishing-related disturbances and potential conflicts across different fishing métier and with other sectors. Specifically, results highlighted the spatial features of the major fishing pressures (e.g., abrasion from trawling) affecting essential fish habitats, marine mammals and turtles in the study area. A portfolio of possible management measures is identified for the study area. It provides clear evidence that, in order to mitigate emerging conflicts and cumulative impacts, it is necessary to combine and integrate different types of measures: spatial measures modulated over time, monitoring and control, actions to fill knowledge gaps, concertation-involvement-co-management actions, improvement of governance systems, actions to support innovation in the sector, etc. Given the complex set of measures discussed, this work can provide a useful contribution to the management of fisheries both at local and regional level, fostering the transition to sustainable fisheries. © 2021 by the authors.

Despite relevant research efforts, information about its distribution is still scarce, particularly in the open sea where they may be exposed to different threats, among which marine litter is of great concern. Here we investigated the distribution of loggerhead turtles and floating marine macro litter (FMML) in the Sardinia Channel and Strait of Sicily, a key area of the central Mediterranean Sea, by using 7 years of data collected by experienced observers aboard passenger ferries along commercial routes. The high-risk exposure areas were identified and the influence of upper layer currents on turtle and FMML distribution was evaluated. Overall, loggerhead sighting rates were higher than those reported from other Mediterranean routes, but the distribution of turtles within the study area was clearly heterogeneous and influenced by the surface circulation pattern. Summer sighting rates were significantly higher in the Sardinia Channel with respect to the Strait of Sicily. Analysis of the co-occurrence of FMML and loggerhead turtles identified a priority risk area in the central Sardinian channel where the large South-Eastern Sardinia Gyre acts as a trap for both animals and FMML. This study corroborates the effectiveness of using passenger ferries as platforms of observation to conduct systematic surveys of sea turtles and floating macro litter in offshore areas. Results highlighted the importance of the Sardinia Channel and Strait of Sicily for the loggerhead turtle and the areas of greater risk of exposure to the marine litter threat.

A sharp decrease in the beam trawl catch observed since 2015 has raised concern about not only socio-economic issues but also ecological issues and the effect that beam trawl fisheries have had on exploited stocks. Besides the effect that beam trawl fisheries can have on targeted economically important species, intensive dredging can cause long-term changes in the benthic community. Therefore, this study aimed to detect the effect that this type of fishing gear has on target and by-catch species. Furthermore, survey data were compared with the official beam trawl fishery data gathered through Vessel Monitoring System data together with fishermen’s logbooks. Our research targeted two adjacent areas: an area where beam trawl fishing is allowed and an area where it is forbidden. The results demonstrate that the commercially important catch represented a minor share of the total beam trawl catch in both survey areas, while discard made up more than 93% of the total catch. The main beam trawl commercially important species in the Croatian part of the northern Adriatic Sea was Pecten jacobaeus, followed by Solea solea and Ostrea edulis.

Our results reflect fairly stable populations in terms of diversity, with some increase in density and standardized biomass of some species dwelling on the continental shelf, and even for some species dwelling on the slope. In contrast, decreasing trends were observed in some deep-water species. This can be explained by the reduction of the trawling effort on the continental shelf over the last few decades, and the shift of the fleet towards deep waters, along with the greater resilience displayed by some species. Furthermore, a decreasing trend in maturity of Scyliorhinus canicula was detected, suggesting an evolutionary response to overfishing. These results improve scientific knowledge for developing true adaptive management in the Mediterranean that will implement measures to strengthen or initiate the recovery of chondrichthyans. © 2020, The Author(s).;English;Article;All Open Access, Gold, Green;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Does not quantify the impact of fishing on chondrychtyans, just say fishing could possibly be the explanation of trends in biomass , diversity and size distribution;4.2;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Potier

However, there is still little knowledge surrounding the impact of fishing on species of skate in the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. Using data from historical records, landings and vulnerability of the species, this study analyses the potential impact of trawling on species of skate in two areas: the western Mediterranean (Alboran Sea) and the Gulf of Cádiz. Results show that trawling mainly affects one species in the western Mediterranean, the starry ray (Raja asterias). In the Gulf of Cádiz, the three skate species that are mainly affected are the thornback ray (Raja clavata), the starry ray (R. asterias) and the undulate skate (R. undulata), but also five other species were caught in the same area, Leucoraja naveus, L. circularis, Raja brachyura, R. miraletus and R. montagui. Vulnerability assessment of the species indicate that all skate species, except Raja asterias, R. miraletus and R. montagui, achieve high vulnerability index (i.e. IV > 60) and all (except R miraletus and R. montagui) are classified in the IUCN Red List as near threatened or endangered species. Based on the results, this study proposes recommendations for measures to protect skates from trawling in these areas. © SFI;English;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The main objectives were (1) to develop a standard protocol from an interdisciplinary expert committee, (2) to obtain baseline information of seabird association with trawlers to be able to track changes and (3) to understand seabird abundance in relation to discard facilitation processes based on environmental and fishing parameters. Based on the developed standard protocol, more than 21 species of seabirds were recorded in 241 fishing hauls in the Bay of Biscay (ICES areas 8abd). This biogeographic area is an important migratory flyway and wintering area, where maximum number of seabirds attending trawlers were recorded between December and April (2015–2019). Based on Generalised Linear Models, seabird abundance was higher in multiple situations: harsher environmental conditions, less available discards, shallower areas, increased period of discard availability, higher number of trawlers simultaneously operating in the same fishing ground, in addition to the months of February and April. The core discarding ground was located in the outer French shelf between the latitudinal range of 44.5°N and 46°N, especially for otter trawl fishing.

We present an approach to predict their effects on benthic communities, and use the approach to estimate the state, the biomass relative to carrying capacity, of the Baltic Sea at the local, habitat, and regional scale. Responses to both pressures are expected to depend on the longevity of fauna, which is predicted from benthic data from 1558 locations. We find that communities in low-salinity regions mostly consist of short-lived species, which are, in our model, more resilient than those of the saline areas. The model predicts that in 14% of the Baltic Sea region benthic biomass is reduced by at least 50%, whereas an additional 8% of the region has reductions of 10-50%. The effects of hypoxia occur over larger spatial scales and lead to a low state of especially deep habitats. The approach is based on a simple characterization of the benthic community, which comes with high uncertainty, but allows for the identification of benthic habitats that are at greatest risk and prioritization of management actions at the regional scale.

These demersal gear types are characterised by a variety of métiers (fishing operations targeting a specific assemblage of species, using specific gear, during a precise period of the year and/or within a specific area). Data on fishing methods, target species and turtle bycatch were collected through interviews in three different study areas in the central Mediterranean. The results show that, even in the same fishing area, different métiers of the same gear can have a different impact on turtles. These findings have several implications. First, traditional turtle bycatch estimations and comparisons based on a fishing gear as a whole may be spatially or temporally biased by spatial and temporal differences in métier composition, respectively. Second, the efficiency of conservation measures may be different according to the métiers involved and caution is needed when measures developed in small areas with certain métiers are exported to a wider scale with possibly very different métiers. Third, conservation measures may induce shifts among métiers that may have an impact on other species, but such shifts are difficult to detect. All this suggests that, in the Mediterranean, a métier-based approach is needed to provide realistic estimates of turtle bycatch, to increase the efficiency of conservation measures by targeting only the most relevant métiers and to predict the changes in target species and effort distribution that can be driven by conservation measures. The variability of fishing methods and métiers implies that the most effective management strategies should be identified at relatively small geographical scales. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.;English;Article;;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;quantify the implication of each metier in turtle by catch.

The model is stage-specific and includes a ‘Wisconsin’ type bioenergetics, a diel vertical migration and a population dynamics module, with the incorporation of known differences in biological attributes between the anchovy and sardine stocks. A new energy allocation/egg production algorithm was developed, allowing for breeding pattern to move along the capital-income breeding continuum. Fish growth was calibrated against available size-at-age data by tuning food consumption (the half saturation coefficients) using a genetic algorithm. After a ten-years spin up, the model reproduced well the magnitude of population biomasses and spawning periods of the two species in the N. Aegean Sea. Surprisingly, model simulations revealed that anchovy depends primarily on stored energy for egg production (mostly capital breeder) whereas sardine depends heavily on direct food intake (income breeder). This is related to the peculiar phenology of plankton production in the area, with mesozooplankton concentration exhibiting a sharp decrease from early summer to autumn and a subsequent increase from winter to early summer. Monthly changes in somatic condition of fish collected on board the commercial purse seine fleet followed closely the simulated mesozooplankton concentration. Finally, model simulations showed that, when both the anchovy and sardine stocks are overexploited, the mesozooplankton concentration increases, which may open up ecological space for competing species. The importance of protecting the recruit spawners was highlighted with model simulations testing the effect of changing the timing of the existing 2.5-months closed period.

Data from 101 dredging operations were analysed for contrasting spatial and seasonal variability of damage, with the use of a three-level damage scale. 4.5% of discarded individuals displayed intermediate damage, whereas 11.3% displayed severe damage. Echinoderms displayed the highest level of damage (~75% of total collected individuals) and Echinocardium cf. mediterraneum was the most susceptible discarded species (85% with severe damage), followed by bivalves (7.3%) and crustaceans (3.3%). The target Chamelea gallina showed a low proportion of damaged individuals, probably due to their thick protective shell, which promotes the survival of discarded undersized target individuals. Spatial differences in damage level on discards were linked to some gear characteristics, to the higher amount of gravels and to longer tow durations, whereas damage was generally higher in cold months and partly related to higher quantities of hard shelled molluscs, in both cases increasing the abrasion and damage to retained organisms. Data suggest that dredges with a lower number of narrower iron teeth and towed for a shorter time could decrease the damage rate in discards of this fishery. A spatial management plan based on the type of grounds would be useful in order to improve efficiency of these fisheries and minimize their impact to soft bottoms with different commercial catches and biological communities.

Submarine canyons are complex environments that can harbor high biodiversity of benthic ecosystems and high biomass of fish species, thus representing preferential fishing areas for bottom trawling fleets. The effects of bottom trawling on the benthic epifauna were investigated over the soft-bottom margins of the Gioia Canyon (Southeastern Tyrrhenian Sea) by means of quantitative analysis of Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) video transects and compared with the recent pattern of trawling intensity, reconstructed through processing of data collected with the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS). Four ROV transects were then performed at 320–540 m depth in areas affected by different trawling pressure. The analysis was focused on the bamboo coral Isidella elongata and the sea pen Funiculina quadrangularis, which are considered indicator taxa of Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs) and relevant in terms of sustainable management priorities. I. elongata only occurred at the two deeper stations, below 400 m depth. This species showed a clear relationship with trawling intensity, since its abundance was significantly higher under low trawling intensity, where coexistence of large (>20 cm height) and small colonies was observed. The relatively high prevalence of small colonies in areas exposed to higher trawling effort was interpreted as a consequence of the trawling activity that removed the larger colonies. However, the frequent occurrence of dead colonies and the diffuse presence of epibionts (e.g. the anemone Amphianthus dohrnii and the hydroid Clytia linearis) on living colonies indicate stressful conditions for I. elongata even in areas where trawling intensity was lower. Conversely, the relationship between trawling intensity and species abundance was not straightforward for F. quadrangularis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As a result, trawl samples still hold a great potential to reveal information about deep-water biodiversity. The rare Mediterranean CWC species Placogorgia coronata was repeatedly found in the bottom trawl discards of the red shrimp fishery in Santa Margherita Ligure (Ligurian Sea). The supposed rarity of this species is strongly biased by taxonomic problems within the genus as well as by the limited exploration of these deep habitats. Scientific literature as well as remotely operated vehicle surveys highlighted the presence, in the investigated trawled area, of a dead white coral framework, supporting the hypothesis that the CWC studied, probably thriving on coral rubble, occurs here due to the natural protection to trawling offered by the coral matrix. Trawlers, however, may accidentally affect these secondary hard grounds, as demonstrated by the discard content. The long-term monitoring of the catches highlighted a removal rate of up to one colony every two trawling operations;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To investigate how trawling pressure is affecting the macrofaunal assemblages, we compared the standing stock (abundance and biomass), community structure and taxonomical and trophic diversity in areas subjected to varying trawling pressure along the SW Portuguese upper slope, between 200 and 600 m. In addition to trawling pressure, several environmental variables, namely depth, grain size and organic matter, were correlated with the biological component, which suggest that the longstanding trawling pressure presents cumulative effects to the habitat heterogeneity known to characterise the West Iberian Margin fauna. Furthermore, our results showed a depletion of macro-infaunal abundances in both the fishing ground and the adjacent area (up to 3 times lower), when compared to the area not trawled. The observed decrease in abundance with increasing trawling pressure was also associated with a loss of species and trophic richness, but univariate diversity indices related with community structure (i.e. Shannon-Wiener index, Pielou's evenness) failed to detect consistent differences across areas. Also observed was a decrease in the number of taxa – trophic guilds combinations of the core assemblage (i.e. characteristic, dominant or frequent taxa) with increasing trawling pressure. We suggest that, in disturbed sediments, the lower functional redundancy resulting from the loss of species within most feeding guilds increases the vulnerability of trophic interactions and therefore of the whole assemblage to further increases in natural and anthropogenic disturbance or their synergistic effects. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd;English;Article;All Open Access, Green;Scopus;NA;Western Waters - non CS;50,000-100,000;two year;5,000-10,000;snapshot/no repeat sampling;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;nMDS analysis _ PERMANOVA _ Dunn's post hoc test _ Bonferroni correction;2;2;3;"""The present study indicated a depletion of macro-infaunal standing stocks (mainly abundance), as well as taxonomic and trophic richness in the fishing ground and the adjacent area, but univariate biodiversity";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SW4_0462;E4;Bonanomi S., Pulcinella J., Fortuna C.M., Moro F., Sala A.;Elasmobranch bycatch in the Italian Adriatic pelagic trawl fishery;2018;PLoS ONE;13;1;;;10.1371/journal.pone.0191647;;Elasmobranchs are among the most threatened long-lived marine species worldwide, and incidental capture is a major source of mortality. The northern central Adriatic Sea, though one of the most overfished basins of the Mediterranean Sea, supports a very valuable marine biodiversity, including elasmobranchs. This study assesses the impact of the northern central Adriatic pelagic trawl fishery on common smooth-hound (Mustelus mustelus), spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias), common eagle ray (Myliobatis aquila), and pelagic stingray (Pteroplatytrygon violacea) by examining incidental catches recorded between 2006 and 2015. The distribution of bycatch events was evaluated using geo-referenced data. Generalized Linear Models were computed to standardize the catch of the four species and to predict the relative abundance of bycatch events. Data analysis shows that most bycatch events involving all four species occurred in the northern Adriatic Sea. The models predicted significant, distinct temporal patterns of standardized catches in line with previous investigations. Water depth, season, and fishing region were the best predictors to explain bycatch events. The present data suggest that the northern Adriatic may be an important nursery area for several elasmobranchs. They also highlight the urgent need for a better understanding of the interactions between elasmobranchs and fisheries to develop and apply suitable, ad hoc management measures. © 2018 Bonanomi et al.

Here, we use fish feeding behaviour, a biological trait easily impaired by trawling disturbance, to depict alterations in fish condition (i.e. individual fitness) and feeding opportunities. The benthivorous fish Mullus barbatus barbatus was selected as a model species. The observed trends of responses to trawling in prey species confirmed the effectiveness of a non-trawled zone in sustaining higher levels of diet diversity (e.g. quantity and quality of ingested prey) and fish condition values (e.g. morphometric and physiological Condition Index). Changes observed in fish prey selection confirmed the role of trawling disturbance in modifying the local soft bottoms community, producing alterations of prey availability that trigger shifts in fish diet. Trawling-induced feeding patterns, mirrored through stomach contents, can positively or negatively affect fish condition, the main driver of population dynamics in maintaining carrying capacity levels.

Recent studies have shown how bottom trawling can drive seascape reshaping at large spatial scales and enhance sediment transport in submarine canyons, which subsequently impacts deep-sea ecosystems. Present knowledge on the transfer and accumulation of sediment flows triggered by bottom trawling is based on localized and infrequent measurements whilst a more complete picture of the process is needed. The present work focuses on the modeling of sediment transport and accumulation resulting from trawling activities in La Fonera submarine canyon, northwestern Mediterranean Sea, thus contributing to an improved assessment of trawling impacts. Based on mooring data within a canyon gully, we use an inverse model to retrieve the unknown time series of resuspension due to trawling over the fishing grounds. This resuspension is later used as forcing for the direct problem: we simulate trawling-induced flows through the canyon and provide a 3D visualization of potential trawling impacts on sediment dynamics, including the identification of the propagation patterns of sediments resuspended by trawling. Flows coming from shallower fishing grounds are funneled through canyon flank gullies towards the canyon axis, with part of the resuspended sediment reaching the continental rise out of the canyon across the open continental slope. Trawling-induced sediment flows promote sediment accumulation beyond the canyon mouth. Given the wide geographical distribution of bottom trawling, our results have far-reaching implications that go much beyond La Fonera submarine canyon.

The extent and intensity of bottom trawling on the European continental shelf (0-1000 m) was analysed from logbook statistics and vessel monitoring system data for 2010-2012 at a grid cell resolution of 1 1 min longitude and latitude. Trawling intensity profiles with seabed impact at the surface and subsurface level are presented for 14 management areas in the North-east Atlantic, Baltic Sea and Mediterranean Sea. The footprint of the management areas ranged between 53-99% and 6-94% for the depth zone from 0 to 200 m (Shallow) and from 201 to 1000 m (Deep), respectively. The footprint was estimated as the total area of all grid cells that were trawled fully or partially. Excluding the untrawled proportions reduced the footprint estimates to 28-85% and 2-77%. Largest footprints per unit landings were observed off Portugal and in the Mediterranean Sea. Mean trawling intensity ranged between 0.5 and 8.5 times per year, but was less in the Deep zone with a maximum intensity of 6.4. Highest intensities were recorded in the Skagerrak-Kattegat, Iberian Portuguese area, Tyrrhenian Sea and Adriatic Sea. Bottom trawling was highly aggregated. For the Shallow zone the seabed area where 90% of the effort occurred comprised between 17% and 63% (median 36%) of the management area. Footprints were high over a broad range of soft sediment habitats. Using the longevity distribution of the untrawled infaunal community, the seabed integrity was estimated as the proportion of the biomass of benthic taxa where the trawling interval at the subsurface level exceeds their life span. Seabed integrity was low (>0.1) in large parts of the European continental shelfs, although smaller pockets of seabed with higher integrity values occur. The methods developed here integrate official fishing effort statistics and industry-based gear information to provide high-resolution pressure maps and indicators, which greatly improve the basis for assessing and managing benthic pressure from bottom trawling. Further they provide quantitative estimates of trawling impact on a continuous scale by which managers can steer. © International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2016.

However, there is recent growing evidence that small-scale fisheries may be the largest threat to marine species of conservation concern. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential impact of the trammel net fishery on elasmobranchs in the Gulf of Gabès, Southern Tunisia. Data are based on 191 shrimp trammel net set (40 mm stretched mesh size) surveys conducted aboard commercial fishing vessels from May to July 2009. Five species of the small coastal elasmobranchs (Mustelus mustelus (Linnaeus, 1758), Mustelus punctulatus Risso 1827, Dasyatis pastinaca (Linnaeus, 1758), Dasyatis marmorata (Steindachner, 1892) and Torpedo torpedo (Linnaeus, 1758)) and two species from the large coastal shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus (Nardo, 1827) and Carcharhinus brevipinna (Müller & Henle, 1839)) were recognized as by-catch in this fishery. Elasmobranch by-catch was dominated by sharks (90.3%), smoothhound sharks Mustelus sp. being by far the most important (88.9%) and reflecting their abundance in the area;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We sampled fishery discards in the fishing grounds of Palamós (the main harbour for this fishery on the Catalan margin), which are located in several areas of a submarine canyon. We found that the discard ratio in this fishery showed a marked seasonal variability, with a maximum in spring and a minimum in summer. Most of the discarded biomass (almost 96%) were of species with no commercial interest. Within these, the most represented group was elasmobranchs, making up to more than 50% of total discarded biomass. Our findings show that the landing obligation established by the EU will have a low impact in mitigating discards in this fishery, as the vast majority of discards are non-commercial species that are not specified in the regulation. Alternative management strategies, such as a temporary fishery closure in spring (when the discard ratio reaches its maximum), should be considered in order to preserve the vulnerable ecosystem hosted by the submarine canyon. © 2016 CSIC.;English;Article;All Open Access, Gold, Green;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;The study only assess the link between season, fishing ground and discard ratio.;4.2;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Potier

Traditionally fishing pressures are calculated top-down by making use of large-scale statistics such as logbook data. Here, we take a different approach starting from the gear itself (design and dimensions) to estimate the physical interactions with the seabed at the level of the individual fishing operation. We defined 14 distinct towed gear groups in European waters (eight otter trawl groups, three beam trawl groups, two demersal seine groups, and one dredge group), for which we established gear ""footprints"". The footprint of a gear is defined as the relative contribution from individual larger gear components, such as trawl doors, sweeps, and groundgear, to the total area and severity of the gear's impact. An industry-based survey covering 13 countries provided the basis for estimating the relative impact-area contributions from individual gear components, whereas sediment penetration was estimated based on a literature review. For each gear group, a vessel size-gear size relationship was estimated to enable the prediction of gear footprint area and sediment penetration from vessel size. Application of these relationships with average vessel sizes and towing speeds provided hourly swept-area estimates by mCrossed D sign tier. Scottish seining has the largest overall gear footprint of ~1.6 km2 h-1 of which 0.08 km2 has an impact at the subsurface level (sediment penetration = 2 cm). Beam trawling for flatfish ranks low when comparing overall footprint size/hour but ranks substantially higher when comparing only impact at the subsurface level (0.19 km2h-1). These results have substantial implications for the definition, estimation, and monitoring of fishing pressure indicators, which are discussed in the context of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management. © 2015 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2015.

During this period, commercial fisheries for deep-water sharks went from being entirely unregulated, to being briefly managed, to being completely prohibited. A total of 22 species of shark and 10 species of skate were recorded between depths of 300 and 2030 m. All showed strong species-specific depth-related trends in abundance. Out of the 11 more common species, five showed no change in relative abundance over time, two (Centrophorus squamosus and Centroselachus crepidater) declined significantly and four increased in relative abundance (Apristurus aphyodes, Apristurus microps, Galeus melastomus and Deania calcea). Assuming these populations were depleted by fisheries in the past, the current data do not suggest there has been an overall recovery. Positive signs for some species in the most recent years suggest movement or recruitment back into the area;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, currently 95% of assessed stocks are overexploited and 73% of demersal species are not assessed. To explore the risk of overexploitation to un-assessed stocks, vulnerability scores were constructed using Productivity Susceptibility Analysis (PSA) for 151 Mediterranean demersal fish species. Out of 151 species, 58 displayed low vulnerability, 20 medium vulnerability, 25 high vulnerability and 48 were considered of major concern. More than half of stocks showed a risk of being overfished (termed ""vulnerability""), greater than that of the stocks currently assessed in the Mediterranean Sea. Most of the cartilagineous fish fell into the high and major concern areas. The quality of data used for the PSA was scored and these scores could be used to improve future collection of data. Vulnerability scores are well correlated with IUCN red list classification. To rank the priority of commercial stocks still to be assessed, vulnerability scores were scaled with landings and mean price per stock. Eight of the top fifteen ranking stocks are currently not assessed. When the vulnerability of cartilaginous fish was tested against rate of decline estimated from trawl survey time-series, no strong correlation was found. The exploitation ratio (F/Fmsy) of assessed stocks was regressed, using generalized mixed models, against PSA scores and area and a significant relationship was found. Using this result, assessed stocks were used as a training set to predict the exploitation of un-assessed stocks. F/Fmsy was predicted for 151 species in 14 management areas (GSAs). The results over all areas is that 39 species-area combinations are exploited sustainably, all occurring in area 20 (Greece), while the remaining 2075 are exploited unsustainably with respect to Fmsy (F/Fmsy>1). This prediction model, albeit after further refinement with more data and testing, could be used to predict exploitation ratio when no information on stock status is available. We predict that ˜98% of the unassessed demersal fish species are potentially overexploited in the evaluated areas. This makes it clear that strong management action will be required to achieve the targets of the Common Fisheries Policy in the next 1-5 years. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.";English;Article;;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Does not quantify the impact of fishing but calculate vulnerability rates by making some assumptions;4.2;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Potier

However, a potential for management synergy arises if fisheries related benefits can be associated with the protection of shipwreck sites.

In this region, the presence or absence of fishing has been correlated to shipwreck condition.

We present late 16th century information on the occurrence and relative abundance of biota in Dutch coastal and inland waters (50 marine fish, 13 diadromous or freshwater and 4 marine mammal species), as well as a description of the sea fisheries (target species, fishing grounds, gear), fish trade, export, and fish consumption in Holland as documented in the handwritten Fish Book by Adriaen Coenen (1577-1581). The species composition and abundances are compared to published trawl survey data from around 1900 and in the 1990s. Fish species that have disappeared almost completely, were already rare around 1900 and are characterised by a large body size (rays and sharks, sturgeon, ling), whereas currently abundant species were already abundant in the 16th century. Intensive fisheries for herring occurred near Orkney, Fairhill and Shetland. Coastal and freshwater fisheries provided fresh fish for local as well as export markets, but also provided bait for the massive offshore hook and line fishery for the production of salted cod, which remained largely unnoticed. Dried flatfish were exported to Germany. Consumption of fish and marine invertebrates differed between social classes. Coenen distinguished eight consumer categories, a refinement of the categories 'rich' and 'poor' used in archaeological studies. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.;English;Article;All Open Access, Green;Scopus;EXCLUDE on study type;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Literature review;4.4;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Potier

Managing the impact requires an understanding of the conditions under which animals are caught and the sections of the population affected. We used observer data collected on an albacore tuna gillnet fishery in the northeast Atlantic, to assess operational and environmental factors contributing to bycatch of common and striped dolphins, using generalised linear models and model averaging. Life history demographics of the captured animals were also investigated. In both species, young males dominated the catch. The age ratio of common dolphins was significantly different from that estimated for the population in the region, based on life tables (G = 17.1, d.f. = 2, p = 0.002). Skewed age and sex ratios may reflect varying vulnerability to capture, through differences in behaviour or segregation in populations. Adult females constituted the second largest portion of the bycatch for both species, with potential consequences for population sustainability. Depth was the most important parameter influencing bycatch of both species and reflected what is known about common and striped dolphin habitat use in the region as the probability of catching common dolphins decreased, and striped dolphins increased, with increasing depth. Striped dolphin capture was similarly influenced by the extent to which operations were conducted in daylight, with the probability of capture increasing with increased operations in the pre-sunset and post-sunrise period, potentially driven by increased ability of observers to record animals during daylight operations, or by diurnal movements increasing contact with the fishery. Effort, based on net length and soak time, had little influence on the probability of capturing either species.

The direct and active involvement of fishermen in the management of marine resources is effective not only for resource conservation, but also for changing fishermen's attitudes. In this study, we proposed and tested the efficacy and suitability of a measure for mitigating the impact of a trap fishery on cuttlefish eggs in the North Adriatic Sea. This measure directly involves fishermen in promoting the conservation of the early, and more vulnerable, stages of the cuttlefish life cycle. Methodology/Principal findings: Through surveys on fishing boats and interviews with fishermen, we found that traps placed in coastal areas during the cuttlefish breeding season have a high impact on cuttlefish eggs, with over 3 million eggs likely being destroyed by 3750 traps of 15 fishermen in less than 3 miles of coast. The use of removable ropes attached inside traps as an additional substrate for egg deposition allowed the recovery of 23.7% of the eggs deposited on the traps on average, without affecting the catch rate of adults. Experiments examining hatching success in the field highlighted the need for a careful choice of hatching sites to maximise the efficacy of the mitigation measure. Conclusions/Significance: The proposed mitigation measure reduced the impact of fishing on cuttlefish eggs, with no significant effect on the commercial catch. Fishermen showed a positive attitude towards the application of this measure, which is inexpensive and easy to employ.

By demonstrating the importance of habitat limitation of two exploited fish species, we provide quantitative support to the benefits of habitat protection for fisheries. © 2013 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.;English;Article;All Open Access, Bronze;Scopus;NA;Baltic Sea - non CS;>100,000;five year;5,000-10,000;two year;Other;spatialized environmental data;GAM;2;2;3;"""Regressions demonstrated no evident effect from fishing""";NA;None;Fisheries independent survey;Fish_teleost;Demersal;NA;NA;Perca flavescens _ Sander vitreus;Catch_and_bycatch;Target;Fishing pressure;environment;Unknown;NA;NA;NA;adult population size;Abundance/biomass/density;No impact;"""However, for pikeperch, there was a non-significant positive correlation between fishing pressure and adult population size, and no trend was found for perch.""";Potier

Community changes, however, are more complex because of species interactions, and variable vulnerability and exposure to fishing. We evaluated long-term changes in the elasmobranch community of the Adriatic Sea, a heavily exploited Mediterranean basin where top-predators have been strongly depleted historically, and fishing developed unevenly between the western and eastern side. Combining and standardizing catch data from five trawl surveys from 1948-2005, we estimated abundance trends and explained community changes using life histories, fish-market and effort data, and historical information. We identified a highly depleted elasmobranch community. Since 1948, catch rates have declined by >94% and 11 species ceased to be detected. The exploitation history and spatial gradients in fishing pressure explained most patterns in abundance and diversity, including the absence of strong compensatory increases. Ecological corridors and large-scale protected areas emerged as potential management options for elasmobranch conservation.;English;Article;All Open Access, Gold, Green;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Does not quantify the impact of fishing -> only compare visually catch rates and mapping of fishing effort.;4.4;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Potier

Applying this concept, we evaluated the capture of elasmobranches in the presence of permanent magnets in hook-and-line and inshore longline fishing experiments. Hooks with neodymium-iron-boron magnets significantly reduced the capture of elasmobranchs overall in comparison with control and procedural control hooks in the hook-and-line experiment. Catches of Atlantic sharpnose shark (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae) and smooth dogfish (Mustelus canis) were signif icantly reduced with magnetic hook-and-line treatments, whereas catches of spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) and clearnose skate (Raja eglanteria) were not. Longline hooks with barium-ferrite magnets significantly reduced total elasmobranch capture when compared with control hooks. In the longline study, capture of blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus) and southern stingrays (Dasyatis americana) was reduced on magnetic hooks, whereas capture of sandbar shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus) was not affected. Teleosts, such as red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau), black sea bass (Centropristis striata), and the bluefish (Pomatomas saltatrix), showed no hook preference in either hook-andline or longline studies. These resultsindicate that permanent magnets, although eliciting species-specific capture trends, warrant further investigation in commercial longline and recreational fisheries, where bycatch mortality is a leading contributor to declines in elasmobranch populations.;English;Article;;Scopus;EXCLUDE on location;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Location: South Carolina;4.2;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Potier

However, anthropogenic alterations are ancient and data on the pristine ecosystem are lacking, making the evaluation of their cumulative effects in the long run challenging. In the Belgian and Dutch parts of the North Sea, a historic data-set (the Gilson's archive) exists to describe various compartments of the marine ecosystem in the first decade of the 20th century (1899-1914). The bulk of samples were acquired in the nearshore (up to 10 nautical miles off the coast) and further offshore in the Hinder banks area. In this contribution, we focus on the sediment information, which consists of 2200 visual descriptions of geo-referenced seafloor samples and 690 archived sub-samples, to reconstruct the seafloor composition 100 years ago. Estimates of mud levels, sand grain size, shell debris levels as well as occurrence of gravel, pebbles and cobbles were derived from the descriptions and standardized. Mud levels and sand grain-size categories were calibrated by means of grain-size analysis of archived samples (n=383 analyses). Large patches of very high mud levels (50-100%) used to occur close to the shore, along the central and eastern coast. The visual sand grain-size categories display a significant trend in their median grain-size, enabling us to identify distinct patches of fine (<250 <U+03B3>m) and medium (250< X<500 <U+03B3>m) sands.

In this study, we observed the line-caught fish for 10 d in a holding tank in order to investigate the independence and impact on mortality of several explanatory variables, including fish size, surface temperature, anatomical hooking location, bleeding, hook type, and line cutting. We observed a total PRM of 24.1% and the most important mortality factor by far was the anatomical position of the hook. Anatomically deeper hooking events were highly correlated with fish size and the presence of blood during hooking injuries. The PRM obtained in this study was higher than values reported in previous studies of this species, mainly because we considered the effects of passive angling techniques. Passive angling increased the incidence of deep hooking and consequently increased mortality compared to active angling. This technique also led to an increase in deep hooking by circle hooks. Therefore, we recommend that active angling techniques be encouraged and we emphasize the need for education on the correct use of circle hooks. This study provides guidelines to managers, scientists, and anglers that will promote sustainable development of the recreational fisheries of the Mediterranean. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Although studies are often undertaken to estimate the impact of a technical measure on the fishery before implementation, rarely have the impacts been assessed ex post. Here, the efficacy of the UK legislation pertaining to the use of sievenets in the North Sea Crangon crangon fishery is assessed. Three impacts were evaluated: on fisher behaviour (social), on the level of bycatch (biological), and on vessel profitability (economic). An apparent high level of compliance by skippers was identified despite a low level of enforcement. The estimated reduction in fleet productivity following the introduction of the legislation was 14%, equalling the mean loss of Crangon landings when using sievenets calculated from catch comparison trawls. Sievenets did reduce the unnecessary capture of unwanted marine organisms, but were least effective at reducing 0-group plaice, which make up the largest component of the bycatch. Clearly the legislation has had an effect in the desired direction, but it does not address sufficiently the bycatch issue in the Crangon fishery. Crown Copyright © 2008.

Our data highlighted significant differences in macrofaunal community structure between the two areas. In addition, the macrofaunal communities in the fished area displayed evidence of a higher level of stress compared with the other one. Several taxa reported in the literature as being sensitive to trawling (e.g., Ebalia tuberosa, Callianassa subterranea) were markedly more abundant in the area not affected by fishing.

SW4_1389;E4;Graham N., Ferro R.S.T., Karp W.A., MacMullen P.;Fishing practice, gear design, and the ecosystem approach - Three case studies demonstrating the effect of management strategy on gear selectivity and discards;2007;ICES Journal of Marine Science;64;4;744;750;10.1093/icesjms/fsm059;;A basic tenet of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management is that harvesting is conducted with minimal impact on juvenile fish, non-target species, and marine habitats. A range of technical modifications of fishing gears aimed at improving their selective properties is available to help achieve these goals, but their effectiveness varies. Through three case studies, we describe how management controls influence fishing behaviour and the adoption of more selective gear, and demonstrate how conservation goals can be discouraged or encouraged by the strategy. In Norway, limits set on the maximum quantity of sublegal fish that may be retained on board, in combination with a ban on discarding, resulted in substantial area closures in the Barents Sea. Therefore, to gain access, fishers developed technical modifications to enhance gear selectivity. In both shrimp and demersal trawl fisheries, the modifications are now being used by virtually the whole fleet. To reduce cod mortality in the North Sea, mesh sizes were increased and effort restrictions introduced, but the measures also affected other fleets, notably those targeting Nephrops: fishers for that species reduced their mesh size to prevent loss of target species and to avoid effort restrictions. Although management measures may have resulted in reduced fishing mortality on cod, they placed additional pressure on other stocks by encouraging vessels to switch gears, and it is likely that discard rates have increased. In the eastern Bering Sea fishery for walleye pollock, the adoption of more-selective fishing gears was encouraged by regulations requiring fisheries to be curtailed when bycatch rates of prohibited species are exceeded, leading to underutilization of the target species through premature closures. Fishers now act cooperatively by providing real-time data on bycatch hot spots, allowing tactical fishing decisions to be taken to avoid such areas. Crown Copyright © 2007.

Since the distribution of fishing effort in the area is not known, the total turtle catch by the Italian bottom trawl fleet was conservatively estimated from the lower catch rate observed in the south-west sub-area: 4273 turtle captures/year (95% C.I.=2186-8546). The actual total catch in the whole north Adriatic is likely to be much higher, due both to an unknown Italian trawling effort in the south-west part with multi-gear vessels and to the Italian and Croatian trawling efforts in the north-east part, where catch rate was 15 times greater than in the south-west part. In the south-west sub-area 9.4% of captured turtles were dead and potential mortality (assuming that all comatose turtles would die too) was 43.8%. Hence, trawling in the north Adriatic is likely to represent a serious threat to the populations, and possible conservation measures are discussed. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Catches are reported almost exclusively by French and British multispecies bottom trawlers. Monthly sampling in the Port-en-Bessin fish market provided biological data about exploited stages that allowed evaluation of catch per species, estimation of catch in numbers and analysis of length frequencies. New species-specific assessments of the 1993-1996 cohorts are presented. Two methods are used with different underlying assumptions. Depletion estimates of recruitment are based on analysis of an abundance index (cpue) in relation to cumulative catch. An analytical approach is also developed using polymodal decomposition of length structures in the context of a given growth curve to obtain catch-at-age data. The estimates derived from both methods show that recruitment can vary by a factor of five. Estimates of fishing mortality from cohort analysis indicate a relatively stable exploitation pattern between years for the dominant species. These parameters are integrated in a Thomson and Bell model to simulate production and biomass of the exploited populations and to generate a diagnostic of the impact of the fishery. For both species, observed exploitation levels were above optimum, but a reduction in fishing mortality would not have resulted in significantly higher yields. © 2002 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

The disturbance due to trawling is most significant in deeper areas with softer sediments where levels of natural disturbance due to wave and tidal action are low. In heavily fished areas, trawls may impact the same area of seabed more than four times per year. A single pass of a beam trawl, the heaviest gear routinely used in shelf sea fisheries, can kill 5-65% of the resident fauna and mix the top few cm of sediment. We expect that sediment community function, carbon mineralisation and biogeochemical fluxes will be strongly affected by trawling activity because the physical effects of trawling are equivalent to those of an extreme bioturbator, and yet, unlike bioturbating macrofauna, trawling does not directly contribute to community metabolism. We used an existing box-model of a generalised soft sediment system to examine the effects of trawling disturbance on carbon mineralisation and chemical concentrations. We contrasted the effects of a natural scenario, where bioturbation is a function of macrobenthos biomass, with an anthropogenic impact scenario where physical disturbance results from trawling rather than the action of bioturbating macrofauna. Simulation results suggest that the effects of low levels of trawling disturbance will be similar to those of natural bioturbators but that high levels of trawling disturbance prevent the modelled system from reaching equilibrium due to large carbon fluxes between oxic and anoxic carbon compartments. The presence of macrobenthos in the natural disturbance scenario allowed sediment chemical storage and fluxes to reach equilibrium. This is because the macrobenthos are important carbon consumers in the system whose presence reduces the magnitude of available carbon fluxes.

In the 1995–96 fishing season, the 5 trawl boats taking part in the project reported that nets in the Eastern Mediterranean trapped 160 Green Turtles and 26 Loggerhead Turtles (Caretta caretta). In the following trawling season (1996/97), 306 Green Turtles, 116 Loggerhead Turtles (Caretta caretta) and 437 Nile Soft-shelled Turtles (Trionyx triunguis) were found to be trapped as a by-catch in the trawling nets. 87% of these turtles were captured by mid-trawling nets, the rest by bottom-trawling nets, mostly at depths of 11–30 m. 95% of all turtles were caught alive and healthy, and were usually released back into the sea immediately after capture by the fishermen. Training measures were given to local fishermen in order to raise their awareness of the threats to marine turtles. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.;English;Article;;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Only studies catch rates and no statistical test;4.2;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Potier

Fishing effort has increased constantly over recent decades. Simultaneously, changes in the benthos of the Wadden Sea have been observed. Besides shifts in species composition of the communities and the disappearance of oyster beds, there has been a distinct decline in the occurrence of Sabellaria reefs. Investigations were carried out to establish whether or not shrimp fisheries might be responsible for the decrease of the reefs. Underwater video techniques enabled direct observation to be made of the fishing gear in action on the sea bottom. The pictures revealed that shrimpers may trawl over the robust reef structures without causing visible damage. These findings are corroborated by the results of field experiments performed on the reefs of Sabellaria alveolata on the French Atlantic coast, and also by empirical calculations of the load of the fishing gear and the compressive strength of the reef. Reasons for the decline of Sabellaria reefs on the German North Sea coast are discussed with respect to natural and anthropogenic changes in the physical environment. © 2000 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.;English;Conference Paper;All Open Access, Bronze;Scopus;NA;CS - North Sea;>100,000;two month;NA;snapshot/no repeat sampling;Visual Analyses of Quadrats/Transects;NA;t test _ U test _  Lord test _ Welch test _ Weir test;2;2;2;"""Investigations were carried out to establish whether or not shrimp fisheries might be responsible for the decrease of the reefs.

In general, the frequency of occurrence of bivalve species declined, whereas scavenger and predator species (crustaceans, gastropods, and sea stars) were observed more frequently in 1986. We suggest that these shifts can be attributed not only to the physical fishery impact, but also to the additional potential food for scavenging and predator species provided by the large amounts of discards and moribund benthos. Our findings are put into the perspective of the general development of the demersal fishery in the southern North Sea. Despite the problems with the historical data set, the comparison presented may be the best illustration achievable of the changes in the benthos from a near-pristine situation to the present conditions after long-term disturbance. © 2000 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.;English;Conference Paper;All Open Access, Bronze, Green;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;The impact of fishing is not quantified, they only study trends in time series;4.3;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Potier

However, improvements in both fishing vessels and trawling gears since the early 1900s have meant that fishing intensity has increased. A resultant increase in the areas trawled and the use of heavier and potentially more destructive gears probably had effects on the marine community. Information on benthic communities within the North Sea, from both published and unpublished sources, has been compiled to provide a long-term data set of changes in the marine benthos on five selected fishing grounds over 60 years. In two of these (Dogger Bank and Inner Shoal), there was no significant difference in community composition between the early 1920s and late 1980s. In the remaining three areas (Dowsing Shoal, Great Silver Pit, and Fisher Bank) significant differences were observed. However, these were the result of changes in abundance of many taxa rather than large-scale losses of sensitive organisms. These results suggest that fishing has influenced benthic communities in the North Sea. The possibility remains that fishing-induced changes had occurred at the Dogger Bank and Inner Shoal prior to the 1920s. © 2000 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.;English;Conference Paper;All Open Access, Bronze;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4.3;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Potier

The experiments took place at 12 stations in the western Aegean Sea and were based on the covered codend method (cover codend: 10 mm from knot-to-knot, 10D). The results of applying multivariate techniques, to the different station/codend combinations suggest that they form groups which differ from each other in terms of species composition, species diversity, and catch numbers/weights per hour of fishing. In general, the 10D covers of 20D and 20S were separated from the 10D covers of 14D. The 20D and 20S codends were generally grouped together and separated from those of 14D and 10D. Finally, the 14D codend either form groups by themselves or group together with the 10D cover codends. In addition, the results indicated that the 20D and 20S codends, when compared with 14D, allow significantly more individuals and number of species to escape through the meshes and are characterised by considerably higher commercial/non-commercial ratios in terms of both weight and number. In absolute numbers and weights 14D caught a very large quantity of non-commercial species whereas the weight of the commercial species caught was among the lowest. The commercial/non-commercial ratios of 20D were higher than those of 20S and, in absolute numbers and weights, 20S caught relatively more non-commercial species than 20D. These facts clearly indicate that 14D is harmful in terms of species diversity for the Hellenic demersal stocks and hence its use should be prohibited.;English;Article;All Open Access, Bronze;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4.2;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Potier

A comparison between the sediment-water interface and the spatial distribution of theoretical wind/wave impact indicated that the sediment is resuspended by further agents at depths below the permanent halocline between 10 and 20 m depth. The climatic deterioration in 1940-1970 had a significant influence on the recurrence of wind-induced resuspension, although this was mostly limited to a 10-30% shortening of the recurrence period. On the other hand, a quantification of the effect of demersal trawling in the same period suggests a total shortening of recurrence at bottoms below the halocline by 75-85% in the autumn and winter, and with one order of magnitude (90%) in spring and summer, compared with the effect of waves only in the 1930s;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Reinvestigating this study area in 1980, a substantially altered faunal composition was recorded. An approach is made to quantify the comparison in terms of abundance, species richness and diversity of invertebrate taxa. Human interference is assumed to be responsible for the major changes. Natural oyster beds have been overexploited and the local population of Ostrea edulis has been driven to extinction. Subsequently, mussels (Mytilus edulis) spread in the entire region, promoted by shell fishery. Particularly barnacles and many polychaetes took advantage of the expansion of mussel banks which is substantiated by correlation analysis. Reefs of the colonial polychaete Sabellaria spinulosa stood in the way of shrimp trawling and became destroyed together with the associated fauna. A subtidal Zostera marina bed was wiped out in 1934 by a natural epidemic disease but never succeeded in reestablishing itself. The associated fauna disappeared. Large epibenthic predators and scavengers (crabs, snails and starfish) survived all these changes. The total number of species remained approximately at the same level but molluscs experienced losses and polychaetes diversified. Overall abundance increased with a disproportionately large share of a few species (Mytilus edulis, Balanus crenatus, Cerastoderma edule, Scoloplos armiger). The subtidal fauna of the Wadden Sea proved to be vulnerable to human disturbance;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The samples were collected with an Otter fishery trawl on three regions, each having five different seafloor depths. The samplings were repeated seasonally in four different months during year 2014–2015, being aimed to provide baseline ecological information on their bathymetric and seasonal distribution and biodiversity patterns. A total of 7 megabenthic non-crustacean phyla were found including 90 species composed mainly of 38 mollusks, 20 echinoderms, and 12 sponges. Three non-crustacean species recorded alien species for the Mediterranean Sea. Number of species for each phylum changed with the seafloor depth. Number of species increased overall from the shallow water to the intermediate water, and then decreased down to the shelf break. The westernmost Mediterranean Sea was incomparable so rich and high in the number of species, biomass and abundance as compared with the easternmost Mediterranean Sea. In general, abundance and biomass increased in summer and decreased in winter in the Mediterranean Sea, particularly at the shallower waters, continental shelf depending mainly on a series variety of organisms' behaviors and environmental conditions. The abundance of epifauna was differentiated by the status of the grounds: fishing and non-fishing grounds. Conomurex persicus changed remarkably the spatiotemporal trends in contrast to no regular seasonal pattern in the faunistic characters in very shallow waters after its introduction. The depth-related gradient was owing to a number of biogeochemical and physical factors interacted with sedimentary characters, light intensity, nutritional condition availability, and temperature. With an exception of few species, the characteristic species for spatio-temporal similarities, the species composition were rather different between the easternmost and westernmost Mediterranean Sea. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.;English;Article;;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4.3;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Romagnoni

To this end, an existing Ecopath ecosystem model was updated with dolphins' abundance estimates derived from a recent dedicated aerial survey. The approach included the quantification of trophic impacts and the estimation of the fraction of production of SPF that is consumed by dolphins and their main competitor, the purse seine (PS) fishery. Overall, competition for resources (i.e., SPF) between purse seines and dolphins was at relatively low levels as revealed by the analyses of flows in the “small pelagic fish - dolphins - fisheries” triangle, despite the relatively high abundance of dolphins in the NAS compared to adjacent areas.

The northern Adriatic Sea has been identified as an important marine mammal area because of a regular occurrence of common bottlenose dolphins. Boat surveys were conducted within a 3,000 km2 sector of the Adriatic Sea off the coast of Veneto, Italy, between April and October 2018–2019. Based on 76 days at sea, 10,711 km of navigation, and 81 h 26 min of dolphin tracking, this study contributes novel quantitative information on dolphin spatial distribution, and on their occurrence in the wake of beam trawlers, otter trawlers, and midwater pair trawlers. A combined generalized additive model and generalized estimation equation framework indicated that trawling—along with other physiographic, biological and anthropogenic variables—influenced dolphin distribution. In days of trawling, the chance of encountering dolphins increased by ~4.5 times (95% confidence interval 1.8–11.0) near active beam trawlers, by ~16.0 times (7.1–36.0) near otter trawlers, and by ~28.9 times (12.0–69.6) near midwater pair trawlers. Spatial modelling was used to create maps of predicted distribution, suggesting differences in habitat use between trawling and no-trawling days. Spatial modelling for all days identified a dolphin distribution hotspot of 832 km2, situated off the Po river delta.

In European waters, chondrichthyes have become a focus of conservation actions due to the abundance declines of several species. In the present study, fishery independent data obtained from the Mediterranean International Trawl Surveys (MEDITS) in the Aegean and E. Ionian Seas (eastern Mediterranean) were coupled with bottom trawl fishing effort data obtained from vessel monitoring systems (VMS) in order to evaluate the effect of fishing on biomass variations of demersal chondrichthyan species. The study focused on commonly captured species such as Raja clavata, Galeus melastomus, Scyliorhinus canicula and Squalus spp, as well as to the total chondrichthyan biomass. The effect of fishing effort on biomass indices, expressed in terms of kg per square km of swept area, was examined by means of Generalized Additive Model techniques, using also the sampling position, year and depth as co-variates. Overall findings suggested a biomass decline of chondrichthyan species with increasing fishing effort. Nevertheless, it was also found that certain species (e.g G. melastomus in both areas and S. canicula in the Aegean Sea) can withstand fishing pressure and it is likely that discard survival rates, depth preferences and fisheries exploitation patterns, are the main drivers explaining variations regarding the impact of fishing on the different stocks. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.;English;Article;;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4.2;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Romagnoni

The effect of trawling was investigated throughout a 5-year period in terms of horizontal/vertical fluxes and changes in seabed mud content, and compared to the natural variability of sediment fluxes at different spatio-temporal scales. Trawling is shown in the model to significantly contribute to sediment re-suspension, and changes in the seabed at the scale of the shelf. The contribution of trawling to re-suspension is >80% during the high fishing season at many locations on the outer shelf and over the Grande-Vasière area (a large and intensively trawled muddy zone located in the middle of the shelf). The contribution of trawling is significantly weaker in winter and at annual scale, particularly over zones with (muddy-) sand facies (between 1‰ and 1%), but remains high, and reaches 20% of the annual erosion over muddy areas (e.g. northern part of the Grande-Vasière). This significant trawling-induced erosion dynamics results in high sediment fluxes which increase natural poleward dynamics from a few percent up to 40%, and contributes to the natural offshore export of sediment on the outer shelf (e.g. +35% of mud fluxes along the 130 m isobath). It is noteworthy that trawling-induced fluxes are larger in winter although the corresponding re-suspension is lower than in summer: this is due to stronger near-bottom flows occurring at this period (largely influenced by energetic wind conditions). In contrast, on the inner shelf, trawling-induced sediment fluxes are rather oriented towards the coast. Finally, simulation results reveal a trawling signature on changes in the seabed. A significant decrease (between 10% and >50%) in mud content is simulated over trawling hotspots, especially over the internal part of the Grande-Vasière and on mud patches located in front of the Gironde estuary. Conversely, trawling causes or intensifies mud deposition on both sides of these preferentially trawled areas. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.;English;Article;All Open Access, Bronze, Green;Scopus;NA;Western Waters - non CS;>100,000;five year;1,000-5,000;subday;Simulated dynamics;NA;oceanographic-sediment model simulation;2;2;2;NA;NA;4.3;Modelling/simulation;Physical_habitats;NA;NA;Mud;NA;Physical disturbance of the seabed;NA;trawling-induced erosion rate;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;NA;Norway lobster _ hake;sediment re-suspension ;Other;Negative;Trawling […] significantly contribute to sediment re-suspension, and changes in the seabed […].

Demersal fisheries are important disturbers of benthic habitats. They often have a heterogeneous spatial distribution, pressurizing particular habitats with high abundances of target species. For the North Sea, we quantified the commonness/rarity of habitats in relation to the environmental determinants of so-called fishing hotspots, to support better-informed conservation planning of benthic habitats in this intensively used continental shelf. Methods We first distinguished 9 main seascapes in the study area based on seabed morphology. Secondly, we determined average fishing intensity and fishing hotspots using VMS-data for the three dominant Dutch fisheries from 2008 to 2015: beam-trawlers targeting sole Solea solea (Beam-Sole), beam-trawlers targeting plaice Pleuronectes platessa (Beam-Plaice), and otter-trawlers targeting Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus and demersal fish (Otter-Mix). Within the seascapes subjected to >80% of the fishing activity, nineteen environmental factors (summarized by PCA) were used to ecologically characterize fishing hotspot locations using MaxEnt response modelling. Results We found that all three fisheries target highly specific, uncommon habitats. Beam-Sole fishers targeted warmer, shallow, dynamic, nearshore habitats, and within these specifically the depressions between sand ridges. Beam-Plaice fishers mainly targeted the exposed, non-muddy flanks of the Dogger Bank and similar large-scale elevations (50–75 km) where especially the ridges of smaller sand banks are used. Otter-Mix fisheries concentrated in areas with low bed shear stress, located in muddy, relatively deeper areas. Implications This study is the first to provide insight in benthic habitat types that are frequently targeted by fishers in the North Sea. We demonstrated unequal exploitation pressure between seabed habitats, with the majority of hotspots in the less common habitats. Our results hence contribute to a more effective, ecologically informed planning for the protection and monitoring of all seabed habitats and biodiversity of the North Sea. © 2018 van der Reijden et al.

This SAC harbours a high diversity of invertebrate communities, and it is located in a very touristy area of the littoral of Malaga and within the limits of one of the most productive shellfish fishing areas of the NW Alboran Sea. Here, the artisanal fishery targeting molluscs is a locally important activity because some species (e.g. Chamelea gallina, Callista chione, Donax trunculus) are highly demanded by locals and tourists and therefore reaching high commercial value. More than 200 molluscan species inhabit the soft bottoms of the SAC “Calahonda”, from which eight species collected in this study have economic value. The bivalve C. gallina was the most abundant and frequent commercial species, mainly at shallow fine and medium sand bottoms, followed by C. chione at coarse sand bottoms. Some species displayed higher abundance values of large or small size individuals at different depths, and most of them showed maximum abundances in spring and summer. Many invertebrate species associated with these soft bottoms are potentially very sensitive to dredging activities, especially echinoderms, decapods and cnidarians. Further research regarding the potential impact of fisheries on these assemblages would be desirable, especially considering the high biodiversity existing within this SAC and the increase of tourists in the last years. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.;English;Article;;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4.4;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Romagnoni

Multi-metric macrobenthos indicators and bottom trawling;2017;Ecological Indicators;82;;260;270;10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.07.004;;The member states of the European Union use multi-metric macrobenthos indicators to monitor the ecological status of their marine waters in relation to the Water Framework and Marine Strategy Framework Directives. The indicators translate the general descriptors of ecological quality in the directives into a single value of ecological status by combining indices of species diversity, species sensitivity and density. Studies and inter-calibration exercises have shown that the indicators respond to chemical pollution and organic enrichment, but little is known about their response to bottom trawling. We use linear mixed effects models to analyze how bottom trawling intensity affects the indicators used in the Danish (Danish Quality Index, DKI) and Swedish (Benthic Quality Index, BQI) environmental monitoring programs in the Kattegat, the sea area between Sweden and Denmark. Using year and station as random variables and trawling intensity, habitat type, salinity and depth as fixed variables we find a significant negative relationship between the BQI indicator and bottom trawling, while the DKI is related significantly to salinity, but not to trawling intensity. Among the indicator components, the species diversity and sensitivity indices used in the DKI are not significantly linked to trawling, and trawling only affects the BQI when species sensitivities are derived from rarefied samples. Because the number of species recorded per sample (species density) is limited by the number of individuals per sample (density), we expect species density and density to be positively correlated. This correlation was confirmed by a simulation model and by statistical analysis of the bottom samples in which log species density was highly significantly related to log density (r = 0.75, df = 144, p < 0.001). Without accounting for the effect of density on species density, indicators based on species density will be affected by temporal and spatial variations in density linked e.g. to variable recruitment success. When this variation is accounted for by random year and station effects we find log trawling intensity to explain more of the variation in log density than in the indicators currently used to monitor Good Ecological and Environmental Status in the Kattegat. Disregarding random effects and the relationship between density and species density, the impacts of bottom trawling are likely to be lost in the translation of ecological quality into macrobenthos indicators. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd;English;Article;All Open Access, Green;Scopus;EXCLUDE on location;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4.3;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Romagnoni

Recreational fishing is strictly regulated inside Italian Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and is generally allocated to local residents, mainly to reduce the tensions caused by limitations of access to the resources. The aim of this study was to provide an analysis of recreational fishing activities within the Portofino MPA (Mediterranean Sea), to assess the possible impact on the local fish stocks and to plan potential management actions. Furthermore, some serious inconsistencies on the minimum lengths of fish caught as defined by law relative to the minimum size of first reproduction are discussed.

SW4_0522;E4;Bastari A., Beccacece J., Ferretti F., Micheli F., Cerrano C.;Local ecological knowledge indicates temporal trends of benthic invertebrates species of the Adriatic Sea;2017;Frontiers in Marine Science;4;MAY;;;10.3389/fmars.2017.00157;;In the Adriatic Sea, shifts in benthic community structure have been attributed to multiple stressors, from the effects of climate change to the impacts of commercial fishing. Some fishing practices, such as bottom trawling, have caused a widespread decline in exploited fish stocks. Bottom trawling is also expected to have negative impacts on benthic habitats, usually structured by and hosting a large array of invertebrate species, which provide important ecological services to fish and commercial invertebrate stocks. However, in contrast to commercial species for which long-term time series of the abundance exist, data on these habitat-forming invertebrates are scarce, as they are usually caught as bycatch and discarded. Therefore, there is great uncertainty about their long-term trends, and if these populations are stable or declining. Here we used interview surveys conducted with bottom-trawling fishers of the central Adriatic Sea to gather local ecological knowledge on megabenthos abundance occurring in their fishing domain, as an alternative source of information to conventional fisheries data. We interviewed 44 fishers, from the most important ports of the Marche region of Italy, to understand how megabenthic species have changed in abundance within the area since the 1980s. Specifically, we asked fishers to provide qualitative abundance scores for 18 invertebrate species in five phyla (Porifera, Cnidaria, Bryozoa, Mollusca, and Echinodermata) based on their recollection of these species' presence in bycatch. We stratified responses in homogeneous temporal periods and geographic sectors of the study area, and analyzed their response with mixed effect ordered logistic regression models in order to evaluate spatiotemporal changes in the perceived abundance of each species. Our analysis suggests that the abundance of the sponge Geodia cydonium, the molluscs Pecten jacobaeus, Atrina fragilis, Neopycnodonte cochlear, and the group of holothurians, have declined. From fishers' perceptions, only the bryozoan Amathia semiconvoluta has increased. Local ecological knowledge can provide important information on environmental change and can highlight species and ecosystems at risk when conventional scientific data are scarce or absent. This approach can be expanded to other regions of the Adriatic and broader Mediterranean Sea to reconstruct change of this heavily exploited marine region. © 2017 Bastari, Beccacece, Ferretti, Micheli and Cerrano.;English;Article;All Open Access, Gold, Green;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4.3;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Romagnoni

Several fishing activities operate simultaneously in the area, and the need to minimize conflicts among them is also a social concern. We applied a spatially and temporally explicit fish and fisheries model to assess the impact of a suite of spatial plans suggested by practitioners that could reduce the pressure on the four demersal stocks of high commercial interest in the GSA 17 and that could promote space sharing between mutually exclusive activities. We found that excluding trawlers from some areas has lowered the effective fishing effort, resulting in some economic losses but providing benefit to the set netters. Not every simulated fishing vessel is impacted in the same way because some fishing communities experienced different economic opportunities, particularly when a 6-nautical mile buffer zone from the coast was implemented in the vicinity of important fishing grounds. Along this buffer zone, the four stocks were only slightly benefiting from the protection of the area and from fewer discards. In contrast, assuming a change in the ability of the population to disperse led to a large effect: Some fish became accessible in the coastal waters, therefore increasing the landings for rangelimited fishers, but the discard rate of fish also increased, greatly impairing the long-term biomass levels. Our evaluation, however, confirmed that no effort is displaced onto vulnerable benthic habitats and to grounds not suitable for the continued operation of fishing. We conclude that the tested spatial management is helpful, but not sufficient to ensure sustainable fishing in the area, and therefore, additional management measures should be taken. Our test platform investigates the interaction between fish and fisheries at a fine geographical scale and simulates data for varying fishing methods and from different harbor communities in a unified framework.

Beam trawling has affected macrobenthic assemblages for centuries, especially the fragile and long-lived species. Due to the prohibition of bean trawling in many OWFs, opportunities are being provided to investigate the potential recovery of vulnerable species and the creation of de-facto Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). The soft-substrate macrobenthic community was investigated from 2008 to 2012, before and after the construction of an OWF in the Belgian part of the North Sea, situated on the Bligh Bank. The fishery enclosed area (±21 km2) within the OWF (No Fishery area) was compared with a surrounding control area (±30 km2) where regular fishing activities were registered through vessel monitoring system (VMS) data throughout the period 2010-2011. Three years after the exclusion of beam trawl fisheries, subtle changes within the macrobenthic community were observed in the No Fishery area. The benthic mysid shrimp Gastrosaccus spinifer (30 ± 15 ind m-2), tube-building polychaetes Terebellidae sp. (196 ± 151 ind m-2) and the echinoderm Echinocyamus pusillus (73 ± 71 ind m-2), sensitive to trawling activities, showed increased abundances within the No Fishery area. With an expansion of the wind farm concession area to 238 km2 in the future, the likely increase of dense Terebellidae patches (e.g., Lanice conchilega reefs) within the No Fishery area could create an ecological important large-scale refugium for higher trophic levels. This study creates a baseline for the evaluation of long-term changes due to the fishing impacts and effects related to the presence of OWFs and highlights the importance of executing long-term monitoring programs in combination with targeted research. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;CS - North Sea;10,000-50,000;five year;5,000-10,000;year;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;BACI;2;2;2;NA;NA;4.3;Field experiment;Benthos;Benthic_epifauna;Other;Sand;NA;Physical disturbance of the seabed;NA;fishery/no fishery area;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;Beam trawl;NA;biomass _ abundance;Abundance/biomass/density;Negative;significant difference in macrobenthic community structure between the two areas and years based on total abundances and total biomass;Romagnoni

Recent changes in fishing effort have dramatically decreased tuna stocks, breaking this balance. Killer whales exhibit two strategies for feeding on tuna: active hunting and depredation on a drop-line fishery. From 1999 to 2011, a small community of 39 individuals was observed in the Strait in spring and summer. All individuals displayed active hunting and 18 of themalso depredated on the fishery. These differences in foraging behaviour influenced life-history parameters. Adult survival for interacting and non-interacting individuals was estimated at 0.991 (SE=0.011) and 0.901 (SE=0.050), respectively. Juvenile survival could only be estimated for interacting individuals as 0.966 (SE = 0.024), because only one juvenile and one calf were observed among non-interacting individuals. None of the interacting calves survived after 2005, following the decrease in drop-line fishery catches. Calving rate was estimated at 0.22 (SE = 0.02) for interacting individuals and 0.02 (SE = 0.01) for non-interacting. Calving interval, which could only be calculated for interacting groups, was 7 years. The population growth rate was positive at 4% for interacting individuals, and no growth was observed for non-interacting individuals. These differences in demographic parameters could be explained by access to larger tuna through depredation. Consequently, we found that whales would need more tuna to cover their daily energy requirementswhile actively hunting. Therefore, our findings suggest an effect of artificial food provisioning on their survival and reproductive output. Urgent actions are needed to ensure the conservation of this, already small, community of killer whales. These include its declaration as Endangered, the implementation of a conservation plan, the creation of a seasonal management area where activities producing underwater noise (i.e. military exercise, seismic surveys or evenwhale watching activities) are forbidden fromMarch to August, and the promotion of bluefin tuna conservation. Additionally, energetic requirements of this whale community should be taken into account when undertaking ecosystem-based fishery management for the Atlantic bluefin tuna stock. In the meantime, as marine predators are most sensitive to changes in fish abundance when prey abundance is low, we suggest an urgent short-term action. Artisanal fisheries, such as drop-lines, should be promoted instead of purse seiners in the Mediterranean Sea. This will help to maintain the survival and reproductive output of the whale community until showing clear signs of recovery and stability, and/or their prey stock recovers. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;Mediterranean - non CS;10,000-50,000;decade;1,000-5,000;year;Visual Analyses of Quadrats/Transects;interviews with fishers;Multistate mark-recapture models;2;1;3;findings suggest an effect of artificial food provisioning on their survival and reproductive output.;NA;4.2;Other;Marine_mammals;Cetaceans;Toothed_cetacean;NA;Orcinus orca;Discarding;NA;effect of artificial food provisioning on survival and reproductive output;Dependence on fisheries for survival through interaction;Commercial;Hooks_and_lines;Vertical line;Thunnus thynnus;abundance _ Interaction with fisheries;Survival;Positive;highly significant;Romagnoni

High fuel consumption, seabed disturbance and high discard rates are well-known disadvantages of this fishing technique. These shortcomings are increasingly gaining international public and political attention, especially with the upcoming discard ban in Europe. The most promising alternative fishing technique meeting both the fisherman's aspirations, and the need for ecological progress is pulse fishing with electrotrawls. Here, the mechanical stimulation by tickler chains or bobbins is replaced by electrical stimulation resulting in reduced bottom contact, fuel costs and discards. Although a significant amount of research has been done on electrotrawls and their impact on marine organisms, most data were published in very diverse sources ranging from local non-peer-reviewed reports with a limited distribution to highly consulted international peer-reviewed journals. Therefore, there is a clear need for a comprehensive yet concise and critical overview, covering and summarizing all these data and making these available for the scientific community. This article aims to meet the above goals by discussing the working principle of electric fields, the history of electrotrawls and their current application in the North Sea and impact on marine organisms. It is concluded by elaborating on the opportunities and challenges for the further implementation of this alternative fishing technique. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.;English;Article;;Scopus;EXCLUDE on study type;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4.3;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Romagnoni

The increasing seal stocks cause notable damage to fisheries in the Baltic Sea, with an unknown number of seals drowning in fishing gear every year. Thus, sustainable seal management requires updated knowledge of the by-catch of seals - the number of specimens that die in fishing gear. We analyse the by-catch of grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) in Finland, Sweden, and Estonia in 2012. We collect data with interviews (35 in Finland, 54 in Sweden, and 72 in Estonia) and analyse them with a hierarchical Bayesian model. The model accounts for variability in seal abundance, seal mortality and fishing effort in different sub-areas of the Baltic Sea and allows us to predict the by-catch in areas where interview data was not available. We provide a detailed description of the survey design and interview methods, and discuss different factors affecting fishermen's motivation to report by-catch and how this may affect the results. Our analysis shows that the total yearly by-catch by trap and gill nets in Finland, Sweden and Estonia is, with 90% probability, more than 1240 but less than 2860;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The increasing seal stocks cause notable damage to fisheries in the Baltic Sea, with an unknown number of seals drowning in fishing gear every year. Thus, sustainable seal management requires updated knowledge of the by-catch of seals - the number of specimens that die in fishing gear. We analyse the by-catch of grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) in Finland, Sweden, and Estonia in 2012. We collect data with interviews (35 in Finland, 54 in Sweden, and 72 in Estonia) and analyse them with a hierarchical Bayesian model. The model accounts for variability in seal abundance, seal mortality and fishing effort in different sub-areas of the Baltic Sea and allows us to predict the by-catch in areas where interview data was not available. We provide a detailed description of the survey design and interview methods, and discuss different factors affecting fishermen's motivation to report by-catch and how this may affect the results. Our analysis shows that the total yearly by-catch by trap and gill nets in Finland, Sweden and Estonia is, with 90% probability, more than 1240 but less than 2860;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SW4_0806;E4;Hutniczak B.;Increasing pressure on unregulated species due to changes in individual vessel quotas: An empirical application to trawler fishing in the Baltic Sea;2014;Marine Resource Economics;29;3;201;217;10.1086/677760;;Individual vessel quotas (IVQs) established on an important target species are a common tool to regulate fisheries. This article investigates fishermen's behavior in a situation in which a primary output quota is decreasing due to policy restrictions, The findings suggest that vessels respond to such situations by increasing pressure on unregulated species, using their spare capacity. This article models fishermen's behavior using a restricted profit function, treating the harvest of regulated species as fixed, while unregulated species are variable outputs. An empirical application is provided for the Polish trawler fleet with permits to harvest IVQ-regulated Atlantic Cod in the Baltic Sea. The results indicate a strong substitute relationship between the cod quota and pelagic species. Derived elasticities of intensity, providing a measure of the impact of a fixedfactor on variable factors, offer strong evidence of increasing pressure on pelagic species caused by decreasing quotas. © 2014 MRE Foundation, Inc.

Effects of demersal trawling were implemented as an additional mortality on benthic fauna, and changes in the benthic-pelagic nutrient and carbon fluxes. The main impacts of climate change were (i) a temperature-driven increase in pelagic metabolic rates and nutrient cycling, (ii) an increase in primary production fuelled by recycled nutrients, (iii) a decrease in benthic biomass due to increased benthic metabolic rates and decreased food supply as a result of the increased pelagic cycling, and (iv) a decrease in near-bed oxygen concentrations. The main impacts of trawling were (i) reduced benthic biomass due to the increased mortality, and (ii) the increased benthic-pelagic nutrient fluxes, with these effects counteracting each other, and relatively small changes in other variables. One important consequence was a large decrease in the de-nitrification flux predicted at the two summer-stratified sites because less benthic nitrate was available.

The current knowledge of the biology of deep-water fish species identifies potential reduced resilience to anthropogenic disturbance. However, there are extreme difficulties in sampling the deep sea, resulting in poorly resolved and indirectly obtained food-web relationships. Here, we modelled the flows and biomasses of a Mediterranean deep-sea ecosystem, the Catalan Sea continental slope at depths of 1000-1400. m. This is the first model of a deep-water ecosystem in the Mediterranean Sea. The objectives were to (a) quantitatively describe the food web structure of the ecosystem, (b) examine the role of key species in the ecosystem, and (c) explore the vulnerability of this deep-sea ecosystem to potential future fishing exploitation. We used the Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) modelling approach and software to model the ecosystem. The trophic model included 18 consumers, a marine snow group, and a sediment detritus group. Trophic network analysis identified low levels of consumer biomass cycling and low system omnivory index when compared with expected values of marine ecosystems, and higher cycling and omnivory when compared with available EwE models of shallower areas of the Mediterranean Sea. The majority of flows in the ecosystem were concentrated at the trophic level of first-order consumers (TL 2). Benthic invertebrates and demersal sharks were identified to have key ecological roles in the ecosystem. We used the dynamic temporal model Ecosim to simulate expansion of the red-shrimp benthic trawl fishery that currently operates at shallower depths, down to 800. m depth. The simulations showed reductions in fish biomass and that the state of the deep continental slope ecosystem in the western Mediterranean seems to be the result of a long-term succession process, which has reached ecological stability, and is particularly vulnerable to human impact and, specifically, to fisheries exploitation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;Mediterranean - non CS;50,000-100,000;multidecadal;NA;year;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;fisheries dependent informaton;EwE;3;2;2;NA;NA;4.4;Modelling/simulation;Foodweb;NA;NA;NA;NA;Catch_and_bycatch;Bycatch;fishing effort;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;Otter trawl;red shrimp;ecosystem indicators;Trophic structure;Negative;Caution has to be expressed in that we consider our results from the dynamic simulations to be optimistic;Romagnoni

With this information and the otter trawl effort data, the environmental requirements and the impact of the trawl fishery on G. acutus populations were analysed.

Deep-water habitats are limited by primary productivity and are mainly dependent on the vertical input of organic matter from the surface. Global change over the latest decades is imparting variations in primary productivity levels across oceans, and thus it has an impact on the amount of organic matter landing on the deep seafloor. In addition, anthropogenic impacts are now reaching the deep ocean. The Mediterranean Sea, the largest enclosed basin on the planet, is not an exception. However, ecosystem-level studies of response to varying food input and anthropogenic stressors on deep-sea ecosystems are still scant. We present here a comparative ecological network analysis of three food webs of the deep Mediterranean Sea, with contrasting trophic structure. After modelling the flows of these food webs with the Ecopath with Ecosim approach, we compared indicators of network structure and functioning. We then developed temporal dynamic simulations varying the organic matter input to evaluate its potential effect. Results show that, following the west-to-east gradient in the Mediterranean Sea of marine snow input, organic matter recycling increases, net production decreases to negative values and trophic organisation is overall reduced. The levels of food-web activity followed the gradient of organic matter availability at the seafloor, confirming that deep-water ecosystems directly depend on marine snow and are therefore influenced by variations of energy input, such as climate-driven changes. In addition, simulations of varying marine snow arrival at the seafloor, combined with the hypothesis of a possible fishery expansion on the lower continental slope in the western basin, evidence that the trawling fishery may pose an impact which could be an order of magnitude stronger than a climate-driven reduction of marine snow. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;Mediterranean - non CS;>100,000;month;>100,000;snapshot/no repeat sampling;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;Deep-sea trawl surveys;Food web modelling  Ecopath with Ecosim;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We assessed the foraging movements of 36 GPS-tracked adult Audouin's gulls breeding at the Ebro Delta (NW Mediterranean), coinciding with the incubation period (May 2011). This also coincided with a trawling moratorium northwards from the colony. We modelled the distribution of the gulls by combining these tracking data with environmental variables (including fishing activities from Vessel Monitoring System, VMS), using Maxent. The modelling range included both marine and terrestrial areas. Models were produced separately for every 2h time interval across the day, and for 2 fishing activity scenarios (workdays vs. weekends), allowing to assess the spatio-temporal distribution patterns of the gulls and the degree of association with fisheries. During workdays, gull distribution at sea fully matched with fishing activities, both trawling (daylight) and purse-seining (nightime). Gulls tended to avoid the area under trawling moratorium, confirming the high influence of fisheries on the distribution patterns of this species. On weekends, gulls made lesser use of the sea and tended to increase the use of rice fields. Overall, Audouin's gull activity was more intense during dailight hours, although birds also showed nocturnal activity, on both workdays and weekends. Nocturnal patterns at sea were more disperse during the latter, probably because these gulls are able to capture small pelagic fish at night in natural conditions, but tend to congregate around purse-seiners (which would enhance their foraging efficiency) in workdays. These results provide important insight for the management of this species. This is of particular relevance under the current scenario of European fisheries policies, since new regulations are aimed at eliminating discards, and this would likely influence Audouin's gull populations. © 2015 Bécares et al.;English;Article;All Open Access, Gold, Green;Scopus;NA;Mediterranean - non CS;>100,000;two week;>100,000;snapshot/no repeat sampling;Data Storage, GPS, Acoustic Taggin;Distribution of fishing vessels: VMS data ;Species distribution modelling (Maxent);2;2;3;NA;NA;None;Modelling/simulation;Seabirds;NA;NA;NA;Larus audouinii;Discarding;NA;Fishing effort;NA;Commercial;NA;NA;NA;Bird density;Abundance/biomass/density;Positive;The gulls are mainly present at sea during trawling activity at day and purse seine activity at night (they rely on trawling discards for more than 75 %).;Seghers

Since the Mediterranean is heavily impacted by commercial fisheries, we also incorporated the distance to fishing harbours in our analyses as a proxy of the availability of discards which are a potential feeding source for Scopoli's Shearwater.

Laboratory analyses were carried out to explore the physiological impairment onset over time, based on emersion and thermal shocks, on farmed individuals. Parallel field-based studies were carried out to also investigate the role of fishing (i.e., otter trawling) in inducing physiological imbalance in different seasonal conditions. The dynamics of physiological recovery from physiological disruption were also studied. Physiological stress was assessed by analysing hemolymph metabolites (L-Lactate, D-glucose, ammonia, and H+), as well as glycogen concentration in muscle tissues. The experiments were carried out according to a factorial scheme considering the three factors (thermal shock, fishing capture, and exposure to air) at two fixed levels in order to explore possible synergistic, additive, or antagonistic effects among factors. Additive effects on physiological parameters were mainly detected when the three factors interacted together while synergistic effects were found as effect of the combination of two factors. This finding highlights that the physiological adaptive and maladaptive processes induced by the stressors result in a dynamic response that may encounter physiological limits when high stress levels are sustained.

Laboratory analyses were carried out to explore the physiological impairment onset over time, based on emersion and thermal shocks, on farmed individuals. Parallel field-based studies were carried out to also investigate the role of fishing (i.e., otter trawling) in inducing physiological imbalance in different seasonal conditions. The dynamics of physiological recovery from physiological disruption were also studied. Physiological stress was assessed by analysing hemolymph metabolites (L-Lactate, D-glucose, ammonia, and H+), as well as glycogen concentration in muscle tissues. The experiments were carried out according to a factorial scheme considering the three factors (thermal shock, fishing capture, and exposure to air) at two fixed levels in order to explore possible synergistic, additive, or antagonistic effects among factors. Additive effects on physiological parameters were mainly detected when the three factors interacted together while synergistic effects were found as effect of the combination of two factors. This finding highlights that the physiological adaptive and maladaptive processes induced by the stressors result in a dynamic response that may encounter physiological limits when high stress levels are sustained. Thus, a further increase in the physiological parameters due to synergies cannot be reached. Moreover, when critical limits are encountered, mortality occurs and physiological parameters reflect the response of the last survivors. In the light of our mortality studies, thermal shock and exposure to air have the main effect on the survival of S. mantis only on trawled individuals, while lab-farmed individuals did not show any mortality during exposure to air until after 2 hours. © 2014 Raicevich et al.;English;Article;All Open Access, Gold, Green;Scopus;NA;CS - Mediterranean;5,000-10,000;half year;5,000-10,000;quarter;Fisheries Dependent Data;NA;Two-way factorial analysis of covariance;2;2;3;NA;NA;None;Lab experiment;Benthos;Benthic_epifauna;Other;Sand;Squilla mantis;Catch_and_bycatch;Bycatch;Fishing capture;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;Otter trawl;NA;Hemolymph metabolites/ pH ;Survival;No impact;No mortality after exposure to air until after 2 hours;Seghers

In particular, trawling has been proposed as a major driver of sediment dynamics at depths below the reach of storm waves, but the issue is at present poorly documented with direct observations. This paper analyses changes in water turbidity in a tributary valley of the La Fonera (=Palamós) submarine canyon, whose flanks are routinely exploited by a local trawling fleet down to depths of 800m. A string of turbidimeters was deployed at 980m water depth inside the tributary for two consecutive years, 2010-2011. The second year, an ADCP profiled the currents 80m above the seafloor. The results illustrate that near-bottom water turbidity at the study site is heavily dominated, both in its magnitude and temporal patterns, by trawling-induced sediment resuspension at the fishing ground. Resuspended sediments are channelised along the tributary in the form of sediment gravity flows, being recorded only during working days and working hours of the trawling fleet. These sediment gravity flows generate turbid plumes that extend to at least 100m above the bottom, reaching suspended sediment concentrations up to 236mgl-1 close to the seafloor (5m above bottom). A few hours after the end of daily trawling activities, water turbidity progressively decreases but resuspended particles remain in suspension for several hours, developing bottom and intermediate nepheloid layers that reach background levels ~2mgl-1 before trawling activities resume. The presence of these nepheloid layers was recorded in a CTD+turbidimeter transect conducted across the fishing ground a few hours after the end of a working day. These results highlight that deep bottom trawling can effectively replace natural processes as the main driving force of sediment resuspension on continental slope regions and generate increased near-bottom water turbidity that propagates from fishing grounds to wider and deeper areas via sediment gravity flows and nepheloid layer development. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.;English;Article;All Open Access, Green;Scopus;NA;Mediterranean - non CS;1,000-5,000;two year;1,000-5,000;day;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;Mooring line with turbidimeters and Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP);Time series;2;2;3;NA;No statistical test mentioned ;4.3;Fisheries independent survey;Physical_habitats;Unknown;NA;NA;NA;Physical disturbance of the seabed;NA;Fishing hours;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;Otter trawl;NA;Suspended sediment concentration;Other;Negative;Trawling-induced resuspension causes turbidity increases near the bottom up to 2 orders of magnitude higher than background levels, with unknown consequences for global biogeochemical cycles and deep-sea ecosystems;Seghers

This paper deals with video data recorded in the heads of French Mediterranean canyons. Quantitative observations were extracted from 101 video films recorded during the MEDSEACAN cruise in 2009 (Aamp/Comex). Qualitative information was extracted from four other cruises (two Marum/Comex cruises in 2009 and 2011 and two Ifremer cruises in 1995 and 2010) to support the previous observations in the Cassidaigne and Lacaze-Duthiers canyons. All the species, fishing impacts and litter recognized in the video films recorded from 180 to 700. m depth were mapped using GIS. The abundances and distributions of benthic fishing resources (marketable fishes, Aristeidae, Octopodidae), Vulnerable Marine Species, trawling scars and litter of 17 canyons were calculated and compared, as was the open slope between the Stoechades and Toulon canyons. Funiculina quadrangularis was rarely observed, being confined for the most part to the Marti canyon and, I. elongata was abundant in three canyons (Bourcart, Marti, Petit-RhÔne). These two cnidarians were encountered in relatively low abundances, and it may be that they have been swept away by repeated trawling. The Lacaze-Duthiers and Cassidaigne canyons comprised the highest densities and largest colony sizes of scleractinian cold-water corals, whose distribution was mapped in detail. These colonies were often seen to be entangled in fishing lines. The alcyonacean Callogorgia verticillata was observed to be highly abundant in the Bourcart canyon and less abundant in several other canyons. This alcyonacean was also severely affected by bottom fishing gears and is proposed as a Vulnerable Marine Species. Our studies on anthropogenic impacts show that seafloor disturbance by benthic fishing is mainly attributable to trawling in the Gulf of Lion and to long lines where rocky substrates are present. The bauxite residue (red mud) expelled in the Cassidaigne canyon was seen to prevent fauna from settling at the bottom of the canyon and it covered much of the flanks. Litter was present in all of the canyons and especially in considerable quantities in the Ligurian Sea, where the heads of the canyons are closer to the coast.

The commercially important, and usually freshwater, vendace (Coregonus albula (L.)) occupying the brackish waters of the Bothnian Bay forms one such marginal population and shows large annual variation in recruitment. Here, we investigate the relative importance of fishing (trawling time), hydro-climatic factors and species interactions in explaining the variability in vendace recruitment using three sets of models. A comparison of the best models in the hydro-climatic model set and the fishing model revealed that the hydro-climatic variables were overall superior to the anthropogenic model in describing recruitment variability. Trawling time and water temperature in winter combined with salinity explained 33 and 63.7% of the variation in recruitment, respectively. The importance of water temperature and salinity, in combination with the effects of trawling time, calls for catch levels to be set with caution in this vendace fishery. © 2013 E.

However, this approach may not be applicable in all cases, in particular for data-limited stocks, which may suffer from uncertain catch information and consequently lack reliable estimates of fishing mortality. In this study we develop an approach to obtain proxies for changes in fishing mortality based on effort information and predicted stock distribution. Cod in the Kattegat is used as an example. We use GAM analyses to predict local cod densities and combine this with spatio-temporal data of fishing effort based on VMS (Vessel Monitoring System). To quantify local fishing impact on the stock, retention probability of the gears is taken into account. The results indicate a substantial decline in the impact of the Danish demersal trawl fleet on cod in the Kattegat in recent years, due to a combination of closed areas, introduction of selective gears and changes in overall effort. © 2013 © 2013 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

However, pelagic trawl fisheries that target sea bass have negative operational interactions with common dolphins (Delphinus delphis). Our goal was to determine the diet of adult sea bass in the Bay of Biscay from stomachcontent and stable-isotope analyses, and explore the dietary overlap between sea bass and common dolphins. We found that sea bass primarily target small pelagic fish, most notably mackerel (Scomber scombrus), scads (Trachurus spp.), anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), and sardine (Sardina pilchardus). These four species also dominated the diets of common dolphins. This overlap in feeding preferences could increase the risk of dolphins being caught by trawl fisheries while feeding among sea bass, and may be an underlying mechanism to explain the high rate of common dolphin bycatch observed in the pelagic trawl fishery for sea bass in the Bay of Biscay.

These two periods coincide with the onset of the commercial deep-water fishery in the late 1970s and the onset of the regulation of the fishery in the early 2000's, which allowed us to investigate changes in the relationship between total demersal fish biomass and depth between the pre-and post commercial fishing periods, as well as changes in the biomass (kg km-2) depth distribution and length frequency distribution of the most dominant fish species. Our results show a decline in total demersal fish biomass of 36% within the depth range of the commercial fishery (< 1500 m). Whilst there were significant declines in target (e.g. Coryphaenoides rupestris decreased by 57%) and non-target (e.g. C. guentheri and Antimora rostrata) species, not all species declined significantly. Changes in the overall length-frequency distribution were detected for 5 out of the 8 dominant species occupying depth ranges both within and outside the maximum depth for commercial trawling. This suggests that whilst there is evidence for likely fishery impacts on the biomass distribution of the demersal fish population as a whole, species-specific impacts are highly variable. It is clear that changes in population structure can extend beyond the depth at which fishing takes place, highlighting the importance for also considering the indirect effects on deep-sea fish populations. © Author(s) 2013.;English;Article;All Open Access, Gold, Green;Scopus;NA;Western Waters - non CS;>100,000;decade;>100,000;year;Regular Fisheries Independent Survey;Trawl surveys;Extended linear model;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

These two periods coincide with the onset of the commercial deep-water fishery in the late 1970s and the onset of the regulation of the fishery in the early 2000's, which allowed us to investigate changes in the relationship between total demersal fish biomass and depth between the pre-and post commercial fishing periods, as well as changes in the biomass (kg km-2) depth distribution and length frequency distribution of the most dominant fish species. Our results show a decline in total demersal fish biomass of 36% within the depth range of the commercial fishery (< 1500 m). Whilst there were significant declines in target (e.g. Coryphaenoides rupestris decreased by 57%) and non-target (e.g. C. guentheri and Antimora rostrata) species, not all species declined significantly.

Historical patterns of exploitation associated with this species suggest that it is currently not possible to manage its fisheries in the Northeast Atlantic sustainably, and the total allowable catch for orange roughy has been gradually reduced to zero for European fisheries since 2010. Orange roughy to the west of Ireland and Britain occurs on distinct bathymetric features (seamounts, hills and canyons) as well as on flat ground along the continental slope. Productivity-susceptibility analysis (PSA) was performed to evaluate the biological vulnerability of orange roughy in relation to other deepwater species and the risk that recent and current fisheries pose to its populations in the study area. Time-dependant PSA, based on the spatial overlap between orange roughy distribution and recent and current deepwater fisheries demonstrated a strong reduction in risk over time when fisheries stopped directed targeting practices and continued with mixed deepwater trawl fisheries. Some spatial overlap between the species and current fisheries remains, and while the method can show relative risk reduction, it cannot provide information on whether the risk is low enough to allow the recovery of depleted populations. © 2013 EDP Sciences, IFREMER, IRD.;English;Article;All Open Access, Bronze, Green;Scopus;NA;Western Waters - non CS;>100,000;five year;>100,000;snapshot/no repeat sampling;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;Scientific deepwater surveys (combined with VMS data);Productivity Susceptibility analyses (PSA);2;2;3;NA;NA;None;Fisheries independent survey;Fish_teleost;Roundfish;NA;NA;Hoplostethus atlanticus;Catch_and_bycatch;Target;Fishing effort;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;NA;Deep-water fisheries;PSA score;Production/productivity;Positive;The change in fishing pattern (from directed targeted practices towards a mixed deepwater trawl fisheries) resulted in a decrease of PSA scores of orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) from a high risk category to a relatively low risk category.;Seghers

For each trawling location, environmental and geographical parameters were recorded, while biomass, abundance, biodiversity and size-based metrics were estimated for the total megafaunal community, as well as for four taxonomic sub-communities (Osteichthyes, Chondrichthyes, Crustacea and Cephalopoda) which were expected to respond differently to environmental changes and fishing. In addition, biomass and abundance of ten species selected based on commercial interest, depth range and life history traits were explored, with particular emphasis on deep-sea species. Fishing effort data collected during the study period were analysed and showed a decreasing trend, mainly due to a decrease in the activity of static nets. The relation between the estimated parameters and environmental and spatial factors, as well as temporal (interannual) effects and the effect of fishing effort were explored using generalized additive models (GAMs). Results of GAMs showed that depth and location explained much of the variation in community metrics, probably reflecting mesoscale spatial features and species/communities requirements.

However, this species has declined with time, its presence in survey data is scarce, and limited information is available about its ecology and the impact of fishing on its populations. We examined key ecological features of this species such as reproduction, trophic behaviour and growth. We assessed the ecological role of this species within the food web using an ecological model of a North-Western Mediterranean ecosystem and setting the new information in an ecosystem context. We then explored impacts of fishing on the starry ray population using a dynamic temporal model and we developed fishing scenarios aiming at recovering the species. Field and modelling results showed that the starry ray is a potentially ecologically important predator of the Mediterranean demersal ecosystems, but its ecological importance in the food web is moderate-low since it is present at a low abundance. Results confirmed that the species has been and still is highly impacted by fishing and it is very sensitive to increasing fishing impacts. However, alternative fishing scenarios showed that Mediterranean starry ray populations may respond under decreasing trawl fishing effort and could substantially recover. The recovery of the starry ray may be accompanied by recovery of other demersal species and could have wider ecosystem impacts. Therefore, this skate could be a good sentinel species to indicate ecosystem health in current Mediterranean Sea ecosystems.

SW4_1086;E4;Wiegand J., Hunter E., Dulvy N.K.;Are spatial closures better than size limits for halting the decline of the North Sea thornback ray, Raja clavata?;2011;Marine and Freshwater Research;62;6;722;733;10.1071/MF10141;;A key challenge of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management is to sustain viable populations of large-bodied less-productive vulnerable elasmobranchs that are the by-catch of fisheries that target more productive species. The North Sea population of the thornback ray (Raja clavata) is now mainly confined to the Thames Estuary and surrounding SW North Sea, which is subject to a flatfish trawl fishery. We explored the relative effectiveness of seasonal closures versus size-based landing restrictions using a four-season age-structured model. More than a third of adult thornback rays are currently removed by fishing each year, and without effective management, a further 90% decline within 30 years is likely. A three-season closure of the Thames Estuary was the shortest closure that ensured thornback ray recovery and minimal loss of fishery yield. Minimum and maximum landing size restrictions are nearly as effective at recovering thornback rays but less so at improving yield. While long seasonal closures and full marine protected areas are more effective at ensuring the recovery of thornback rays, length restrictions may be simpler to implement under the current institutional framework and may have less impact on the multispecies trawl fisheries operating in the area. © CSIRO 2011.;English;Conference Paper;All Open Access, Bronze, Green;Scopus;NA;CS - North Sea;>100,000;five year;>100,000;snapshot/no repeat sampling;Fisheries Dependent Data;CEFAS fisheries;Aged-based matrix model;2;2;3;NA;NA;4.2;Modelling/simulation;Fish_cartilaginous;Skates;NA;NA;Raja clavata;Catch_and_bycatch;Bycatch;Fishing effort;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;NA;Sole fisheries;Population growth rate;Growth;Multiple;A three season closure or a minimum or maximum landing length have a positive effect on the ray population.

Mortality by trawling is mainly due to enforced apnoea during towing activity. In order to reduce the submergence time and consequent turtle mortality, a specific technical modification was developed in the early 1980s: the Turtle Excluder Device (TED). In this paper, we field-tested a typical Supershooter TED and three new types of low-cost TED, built with different designs and materials, incorporating aspects of US and Australian TEDs, as well as design features to improve handling and catch rates. The performance of the TEDs was investigated under commercial fishing conditions in diverse trawling grounds in the Adriatic Sea (Mediterranean). All TEDs were easy to operate and did not require changes to normal fishing operations. Due to lack of entry of turtles it was not possible to evaluate the ability of the different TEDs to release turtles, but one large loggerhead turtle (C. caretta) was captured during the experimental tows and was successfully excluded by the Supershooter. The TEDs reduced anthropogenic debris and, consequently, sorting operations on board. Among the four TEDs tested, both the semi-rigid TED and the Supershooter performed in accordance with the design objectives: total discards were reduced but total commercial catches were not significantly reduced. With the Supershooter, all European hake (Merluccius merluccius) individuals equal to or above 16 cm were found in the codend and 10-15% of those between 5.0 and 15.5 cm were released. In general, the total discard rate of the TED-equipped nets was reduced to around 20-60%. Since the Council Regulation (EC) No. 1967/2006 called for a discard reduction policy in waters under the jurisdiction of the European Union, TEDs may have some broader value in this context. © EDP Sciences, IFREMER, IRD 2011.;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;CS - Mediterranean;10,000-50,000;week;10,000-50,000;snapshot/no repeat sampling;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;Testing of Turtle Excluding Devices ;ANOVA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A multidisciplinary study of trawl and sea snail fisheries in Samsun, Black Sea coast of Turkey;2010;Ocean and Coastal Management;53;05/Jun;252;269;10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2010.04.008;;This study aims to investigate and model driving forces that lead to increased fishing pressure and an altered state of the environment in the coastal areas near Samsun on the Turkish Black Sea coast. We have applied a modified DPSIR model to structure our investigation and analysis and have investigated the drivers that generate fishing pressure in the Samsun fisheries. The overall health of the ecosystem is declining, and there is a consistent trend of deterioration in the condition of the three major species targeted by the trawl fisheries. Although introduced invasive species have brought significant changes to the Black Sea, it is clear that the state of the environment is significantly and negatively affected by the pressure exerted by fisheries. Fishing pressure has to a certain extent been redirected to pelagic trawling as bottom trawling has become less profitable and a rise in catch capacity has levelled off. This reduction is, however, offset by an increase in illegal trawling and dredging by a very rapidly growing sector of multi-purpose small boats, resulting in a considerable increase in the overall accumulated engine power of fishing boats in Samsun during 2000-2005. Fisheries in Samsun, in particular sea snail fisheries, have constituted a frontier of sorts open to the poorer populations of Samsun during the last 20 years, and, thereby, constitute one of the major drivers for fishing pressure. We identify eight drivers of importance for the period 2000-2005. Although the authorities can impact all or most of those drivers, most of them are beyond the scope of conventional 'fisheries management'. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.;English;Article;;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;Black Sea;50,000-100,000;five year;50,000-100,000;snapshot/no repeat sampling;NA;NA;Mainly focussing on drivers of fisheries in the Black Sea (not on impact on ecosystems);NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;None;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Seghers

To assess potential interaction between porpoises and fisheries in the German Bight, high-resolution spatial and temporal data were analysed in order to reveal association patterns between cetaceans and fisheries in the German Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the North Sea. To facilitate interpretation of resulting patterns, additionally, relationships of fish assemblages were analysed. Vessel monitoring system (VMS) data from 2006 and fisheries surveillance data from 2002 to 2006 were acquired to calculate fishing effort, aerial survey data from 2002 to 2006 to evaluate porpoise distribution, and trawl survey data from 2000 to 2007 to assess fish assemblage. Relationships were analysed in terms of seasonal association and overlap. Results showed that porpoise distribution was positively associated with sandeel fisheries in all seasons and with gillnet fisheries in summer. Overlaps for sandeel and gillnet fisheries were high in summer, while negligible in spring and autumn. In spring, high overlap was found for large beam trawlers targeting sole and plaice. In parallel, porpoise distribution was positively linked to fish assemblage components representing sandeel and poor cod in summer and flatfish in spring. Our results suggest that, especially in summer, resource competition between porpoises and industrial sandeel fisheries is likely and the risk of by-catch in gillnets is increased. In spring, interference with sole and plaice fisheries is to be expected. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Little is known however about the effects of bycatch in small-scale gillnet fisheries on bird populations. Here we review 30 studies reporting bird bycatch in coastal gillnet fisheries in the Baltic Sea and the North Sea region in order to assess the magnitude of this problem and potential effects on bird populations. All species of diving birds that occur in the study region, including divers (loons), grebes, sea ducks, diving ducks, auks and cormorants, have been reported as dying in fishing nets. The cumulative bycatch estimate extracted from several localized studies providing such information, suggests that about 90,000 birds die in fishing nets annually, a number that is almost certainly a substantial underestimate. We conclude that it is likely that between 100,000 and 200,000 waterbirds are killed per year. Geographic and temporal patterns of bycatch generally matched species distribution and periods of presence. Also, bycatch rates varied depending on species' foraging technique and were influenced by net parameters and fishing depth. To evaluate effects of additive mortality on bird populations, we applied the Potential Biological Removal (PBR) concept to three species with the most extensive bycatch information. Agreeing with PBR assumptions we conclude that bycatch is a matter of concern for at least two of the three assessed species. We suggest that bycatch research in Europe and beyond should aim at unification of principles for bycatch assessment, setting new standards for the monitoring of waterbird populations so that vital rates and mortality data are recorded, and implementing quantifiable criteria for evaluating effects of fisheries bycatch. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Little is known however about the effects of bycatch in small-scale gillnet fisheries on bird populations. Here we review 30 studies reporting bird bycatch in coastal gillnet fisheries in the Baltic Sea and the North Sea region in order to assess the magnitude of this problem and potential effects on bird populations. All species of diving birds that occur in the study region, including divers (loons), grebes, sea ducks, diving ducks, auks and cormorants, have been reported as dying in fishing nets. The cumulative bycatch estimate extracted from several localized studies providing such information, suggests that about 90,000 birds die in fishing nets annually, a number that is almost certainly a substantial underestimate. We conclude that it is likely that between 100,000 and 200,000 waterbirds are killed per year. Geographic and temporal patterns of bycatch generally matched species distribution and periods of presence. Also, bycatch rates varied depending on species' foraging technique and were influenced by net parameters and fishing depth. To evaluate effects of additive mortality on bird populations, we applied the Potential Biological Removal (PBR) concept to three species with the most extensive bycatch information. Agreeing with PBR assumptions we conclude that bycatch is a matter of concern for at least two of the three assessed species. We suggest that bycatch research in Europe and beyond should aim at unification of principles for bycatch assessment, setting new standards for the monitoring of waterbird populations so that vital rates and mortality data are recorded, and implementing quantifiable criteria for evaluating effects of fisheries bycatch. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Application to the Gulf of Lion (NW Mediterranean);2008;Continental Shelf Research;28;15;2071;2091;10.1016/j.csr.2008.02.002;;Modern sediment deposits on continental margins form a vast reservoir of particulate matter that is regularly affected by resuspension processes. Resuspension by bottom trawling on shelves with strong fishing activity can modify the scale of natural disturbance by waves and currents. Recent field data show that the impact of bottom trawls on fine sediment resuspension per unit surface is comparable with that of the largest storms. We assessed the impact of both natural and anthropogenic processes on the dispersal of riverborne particles and shelf sediments on the Gulf of Lion shelf. We performed realistic numerical simulations of resuspension and transport forced by currents and waves or by a fleet of bottom trawlers. Simulations were conducted for a 16-month period (January 1998-April 1999) to characterise the seasonal variability. The sediment dynamics takes into account bed armoring, ripple geometry and the cohesive and non-cohesive characteristics of the sediments. Essential but uncertain parameters (clay content, erosion fluxes and critical shear stress for cohesive sediment) were set with existing data. Resuspension by waves and currents was controlled by shear stress, whereas resuspension by trawls was controlled by density and distribution of the bottom trawler fleet. Natural resuspension by waves and currents mostly occurred during short seasonal episodes, and was concentrated on the inner shelf. Trawling-induced resuspension, in contrast, occurred regularly throughout the year and was concentrated on the outer shelf. The total annual erosion by trawls (5.6×106 t y-1, t for metric tonnes) was four orders of magnitude lower than the erosion induced by waves and currents (35.3×109 t y-1). However the net resuspension (erosion/deposition budget) for trawling (0.4×106 t y-1) was only one order of magnitude lower than that for waves and currents (9.2×106 t y-1). Off-shelf export concerned the finest fraction of the sediment (clays and fine silts) and took place primarily at the southwestern end of the Gulf. Off-shelf transport was favoured during the winter 1999 by a very intense episode of dense shelf water cascading. Export of sediment resuspended by trawls (0.4×106 t y-1) was one order of magnitude lower than export associated with natural resuspension (8.5×106 t y-1). Trawling-induced resuspension is thought to represent one-third of the total export of suspended sediment from the shelf. A simulation combining both resuspension processes reveals no significant changes in resuspension and export rates compared with the sum of each individual process, suggesting the absence of interference between both processes. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Indicators are required to support the development of this approach. For example, community indicators have been proposed to assess the impact of fishing. We tested here the applicability of one such community indicator, the abundance-biomass comparison (ABC method), as a measure of the impact of bottom trawling (years of sampling: 2001 and 2003) on the benthic invertebrates - typically starfishes, crabs, squat lobsters, shrimps and large hard-shelled molluscs- of ""Grande Vasière"", a major French fishing zone, in the Bay of Biscay. The ABC method is generally used as an impact indicator for different types of physical, biological and anthropogenic disturbances on benthic communities. This method is based on the assumption that increasing disturbance shifts communities from dominance by large-bodied species with low turnover rates toward dominance by small-bodied species with high turnover rates. At less disturbed areas the average biomass of individuals is greater than at more heavily disturbed areas. The ABC method measures this effect by comparing the ranked distributions of abundance and biomass within a given community. We applied the ABC method and compared the size structure and the species diversity at two areas exposed to moderate and high bottom trawl effort.

We conducted a large-scale assessment of bottom trawl fishing of benthic fauna in different habitats, using a theoretical, size-based model that included habitat features. Species richness was estimated based on a generalized body mass versus species richness relationship. The model was validated by sampling 33 stations subject to a range of trawling intensities in four shallow, soft sediment areas in the North Sea. Both the model and the field data demonstrated that trawling reduced biomass, production, and species richness. The impacts of trawling were greatest in areas with low levels of natural disturbance, while the impact of trawling was small in areas with high rates of natural disturbance.

To examine the effect of shrimp trawling on benthic sedimentary habitats a replicated Before/After (B/A) experiment was performed in the Gullmarfjord, Western Sweden, after 6 years protection against trawling activities. The experimental area was randomly divided into three control transects and three trawling transects each ~ 1.5 km long. The experimental fishery activity was designed to mimic the extent and the trawling procedure used before the banning with 80 hauls per site and year. All transects were sampled three times in 1996 before the experimental trawling activity was started, and three times during the experimental trawling activity in the autumn of 1997. Along each transect, 10 replicated sediment profile images (SPIs) were taken randomly at each sampling. The status of the sedimentary habitat was assessed by the parameterisation of a benthic habitat quality (BHQ) index combining sediment surface and subsurface variables and the redox conditions observed in the SPIs. A significant interaction between B/A and treatment was observed in mean BHQ-index. Changes of the BHQ-indices were larger in trawled areas than the natural variation in the experimental area. Mean BHQ-indices in trawled transects were lower than in control transects after the experimental trawling activity was started. In about 43% of the SPIs a severe mechanical disturbance was observed, which introduced a significantly increased spatial variance of BHQ-indices in trawled areas compared to control areas. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Trawling disturbance has wide-ranging impacts on the marine environment and is well known to modify benthic habitat and community structure. This has led to speculation about the positive and negative impacts of trawling on ecosystem processes such as production. 2. Existing theory suggests that frequent trawling disturbance may lead to the proliferation of smaller benthic species, with faster life histories, because they can withstand the mortality imposed by trawling and benefit from reduced competition or predation as populations of larger species are depleted. Since smaller species are more productive, trawling disturbance may 'farm the sea', with knock-on benefits for consumers, including fish populations. 3. We conducted the first large-scale studies of trawling effects on benthic production across quantified gradients of trawling disturbance on real fishing grounds in two regions (Silver Pit and Hills) of the North Sea. There were 27- and 10-fold differences in levels of beam trawl disturbance among the Silver Pit and Hills sites, respectively. 4. Size structure was described using normalized size-spectra, and the slopes and intercepts of these spectra were related to levels of trawling disturbance. Production was estimated from the size spectra, using a new allometric relationship between body mass and the production to biomass (P:B) ratio of marine invertebrates. The general validity of the relationship was confirmed using a phylogenetic comparative approach. 5. In the Silver Pit region, trawling led to significant decreases in infaunal biomass and production. The abundance of larger individuals was depleted more than smaller ones, as reflected by the positive relationship between the slope of the normalized size spectra and trawling disturbance. The effects of trawling disturbance were not significant in the epifaunal community. In the Hills region, where the range of trawling disturbance was lower, trawling disturbance did not have significant effects on biomass or production. 6. In the Silver Pit, relative infaunal production (production per unit biomass) rose with increased trawling disturbance. This was attributable largely to the dominance of smaller animals in the disturbed communities. The increase in relative production did not compensate for the loss of total production that resulted from the depletion of large individuals. There was some evidence for the proliferation of small polychaetes at moderate levels of disturbance, but at higher levels of disturbance their biomass and production fell. 7.

We studied the effects of bottom trawling on the trophic structure of infaunal and epifaunal benthic communities in 2 regions (Silver Pit and Hills) of the central North Sea. Within each region, we quantified long-term (over 5 yr) differences in trawling disturbance at a series of sites (using sightings data from fishery protection flights), and related this to differences in the biomass and trophic structure of the benthic community. There were 27- and 10-fold differences in levels of beam trawl disturbance among the Silver Pit and Hills sites respectively, and we estimated that the frequency with which the entire area of the sites was trawled ranged from 0.2 to 6.5 times yr-1 in the Silver Pit and 0.2 to 2.3 times yr-1 in the Hills. The impacts of-fishing were most pronounced in the Silver Pit region, where the range of trawling disturbance was greater. Infaunal and epifaunal biomass decreased significantly with trawling disturbance. Within the infauna, there were highly significant decreases in the biomass of bivalves and spatangoids (burrowing sea-urchins) but no significant change in polychaetes. Relationships between trophic level (estimated using nitrogen stable isotope composition, d15N) and body mass (as log2 size classes) were rarely significant, implying that the larger individuals in this community did not consistently prey on the smaller ones. For epifauna, the relationships were significant, but the slopes or intercepts of the fitted linear regressions were not significantly related to trawling disturbance. Moreover, mean d15N of the sampled infaunal and epifaunal communities were remarkably consistent across sites and not significantly related to trawling disturbance. Our results suggest that chronic trawling disturbance led to dramatic reductions in the biomass of infauna and epifauna, but these reductions were not reflected in changes to the mean trophic level of the community, or the relationships between the trophic levels of different sizes of epifauna.

Within the infauna, there were highly significant decreases in the biomass of bivalves and spatangoids (burrowing sea-urchins) but no significant change in polychaetes. Relationships between trophic level (estimated using nitrogen stable isotope composition, d15N) and body mass (as log2 size classes) were rarely significant, implying that the larger individuals in this community did not consistently prey on the smaller ones. For epifauna, the relationships were significant, but the slopes or intercepts of the fitted linear regressions were not significantly related to trawling disturbance. Moreover, mean d15N of the sampled infaunal and epifaunal communities were remarkably consistent across sites and not significantly related to trawling disturbance. Our results suggest that chronic trawling disturbance led to dramatic reductions in the biomass of infauna and epifauna, but these reductions were not reflected in changes to the mean trophic level of the community, or the relationships between the trophic levels of different sizes of epifauna.

Atlantic Margin Environmental Survey: Seabed survey of deep-water areas (17(th) round tranches) to the north and west of Scotland;1999;Cruise Report of the Southampton Oceanography Centre;;25;1;171;;;This cruise formed part of the Atlantic Margin Environmental Survey (AMES) 1998. The primary objective of the cruise was to carry out a large-scale seabed sampling survey of six areas of continental slope variously located north and west of Shetland and west of the Hebrides. In total over 100 seabed stations were sampled using either megacorer, box corer or Day grab, generating samples for the subsequent analysis of macrobenthos, hydrocarbons, heavy metals, particle size, total organic carbon and nitrogen and geology. Additional survey operations included photographic observation of the seafloor using still and video cameras mounted on the SOC WASP and epibenthic sledge vehicles and limited sampling with a gravity corer (British Geological Survey). The cruise also re-sampled (primarily for macrobenthos) a bathymetric transect of stations to the west of Shetland previously established during RRS Charles Darwin Cruise 112 C leg 2 (AMES 1996). Shipboard observations of seabed samples and video footage collected in the various survey areas are summarised in the report. Other general observations include (a) the effects of deep-sea trawling, observed to the west of Shetland and the Hebrides;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We used a BACI experimental approach to investigate the short-term effects of beam trawling on the diversity, biomass and community structure of meiofauna on real fishing grounds in the southern North Sea. Experiments at two locations showed that there were no short- to medium-term (1-392 days after experimental trawling) trawling impacts on meiofaunal diversity or biomass, but that there were mild effects on community structure. Any impacts due to trawling were minor in relation to seasonal changes in the meiofaunal communities. We assessed the power of our experiments to detect the effects of trawling and recorded a 44-85% chance of detecting a 50% change in species richness and a 65% chance of detecting an order-of-magnitude change in biomass. The power to detect changes in total abundance, however, was low (between 11% and 12% power for detecting a change of 50%).

Experiments at two locations showed that there were no short- to medium-term (1-392 days after experimental trawling) trawling impacts on meiofaunal diversity or biomass, but that there were mild effects on community structure. Any impacts due to trawling were minor in relation to seasonal changes in the meiofaunal communities. We assessed the power of our experiments to detect the effects of trawling and recorded a 44-85% chance of detecting a 50% change in species richness and a 65% chance of detecting an order-of-magnitude change in biomass. The power to detect changes in total abundance, however, was low (between 11% and 12% power for detecting a change of 50%). We suggest that meiofauna are more resistant to disturbance by beam trawling than are macrofauna and that they have the potential to withstand the effects of chronic trawling on real fishing grounds and to retain a key role in energy cycling.;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;CS - North Sea;5,000-10,000;two year;500-1,000;half year;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;BACI _ ANOVA _ Power Analysis;2;2;3;Meiofauna suffer low direct mortality due to trawling disturbance because they are resuspended rather than crushed by the trawl.

Since the second world war the catches have been well above the inter-war average, reaching the record level of some 110,000 tons twice the inter-war average in 1964. The catch-per-unit-effort has also been high. These changes agree very closely with earlier predictions of the effect of rational management. A reduction of about 40% in total fishing effort (calculated in English steam trawler units) has coincided with a corresponding decrease in the total mortality. A change in the distribution of English fishing from grounds where small fish predominate to grounds where small fish are scarce has caused an increase in the average size and age at first capture of about 5 cm or 12 years respectively. Of the factors that are not directly related to fishing the total number of recruits has not changed, though a larger proportion now comes from the eastern, German Bight, spawning group. There has probably been some increase in growth rate, but not sufficient to account for the observed increase in average size of the individual fish in the landings. It is therefore clearly demonstrated that most of the observed increase of some 40,000 tons in the average annual landings of North Sea plaice is largely due to the two basic elements of rational fishing: less total fishing, and better protection of the small fish. However, these changes in fishing have been fortuitous, and not the result of a deliberate policy of management. They may be reversed in the future, unless steps are now taken to prevent this. © 1968 Oxford University Press.;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;CS - North Sea;>100,000;multidecadal;50,000-100,000;year;Fisheries Dependent Data;NA;changes in %;2;2;3;increase in plaice catches in the North Sea just after the II world war has been due mainly to the two changes less fishing and a better protection of the small fish;changes occurred by chance;4.4;Fisheries dependent survey;Fish_teleost;Flatfish;NA;Unknown;Pleuronectes platessa;Catch_and_bycatch;Target;fishing effort (hours) _ exploitation pattern;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;Otter trawl;Pleuronectes platessa;catches _ fish size _ exploitation rate;Size/age structure;Positive;increase in plaice catches in the North Sea by less fishing and a better protection of the small fish.;Spedicato

As in other areas, the biomass of roundfish species such as cod, pollack, hake, and ling drastically decreased during this period most likely owing to fishing pressure. However, other commercially important fish species, e.g. haddock, whiting, and some flatfish, showed a constant or increasing trend during the same period. Non-commercial species showed no or an increasing trend in ln-cpue, by as much as 40 times in hagfish. Furthermore, analyses of the spatial distribution of 14 selected fish species by means of distribution maps of ln-cpue suggested that fish stocks contracted and expanded in response to decrease and increase of the stock biomass, respectively, with some flatfish species (i.e. plaice and flounder) and hagfish representing the exceptions to this general pattern. © 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

These were tested using a data set comprising stomach contents for dab Limanda limanda collected in March and August in the early 1950s and a matched sample from 1996-97. Changes in samples taken in August were consistent with the hypothesised effects of fishing, with an increased prevalence of scavengers and decreased occurrence of sedentary polychaetes in the diet. There were also marked differences between the 1950s and 1996-97 for March samples due to the high prevalence of fish remains in the contemporary samples.

The importance of these food sources to scavenging benthic species was investigated. To identify epibenthic species showing scavenging behaviour and to detect their food preferences, traps (370 overall) baited with different kinds of carrion (fish, crustaceans, molluscs, echinoderms, polychaetes) were deployed at 14 locations in the southern North Sea. Liocarcinus holsatus, Pagurus bernhardus, Asterias rubens, ophiurids, and small gadoids were the main active scavengers feeding on different kinds of food, while lyssianid amphipods (Orchomene nanus, Scopelocheirus hopei) fed mainly on crustacean carrion. Estimated attraction areas were largest for gadoids, hermit crabs, and swimming crabs. Immigration of fish and swimming crabs into experimentally trawled areas was observed by sampling repeatedly in a trawled strip. Differences in the response to trawling (feeding activity, food niche breadth, and resource partitioning) between selected fish species are described. Limanda limanda, Pleuronectes platessa, Merlangius merlangus, Callionymus lyra, and Eutrigla gurnardus all showed strong responses, using different feeding strategies. In situ clearance rates of dead discarded fish exposed on the sea floor were estimated. Discards as well as moribund benthos were consumed within a few days. The balance between the amount of food materials produced by beam-trawl fishery and the amount of food consumed by potential scavengers was translated in a model of the food flows as mobilized by beam trawling. In general, the direct importance of the additional food resource for populations of scavengers is considered to be relatively small. However, the importance may be relatively larger for scavenging fish than for invertebrates. It is estimated that after a single beam trawling about 1.27 gm-2 ash-free dry biomass, or 6% to 13% of the annual secondary production of macrobenthos per unit area, would suddenly become available to scavengers and to the detritus food chain.

These two localities showed marked differences in the features of the commercial fishing fleet: in the Ebro Delta area a large fishing fleet produced large amounts of discards, while in the Chafarinas the fleet discarded smaller amounts of fish and marine invertebrates, due to the smaller number of vessels. It is also likely that the percentage of discards from total catches is also lower around the Chafarinas than at the Ebro Delta. We distinguished two types of fishing to compare diet compositions: diurnal (only trawling activity) and diurnal and nocturnal (trawling and purse-seine activity, respectively). We also differentiated regurgitates from young nestlings (up to 20 days old) and from older nestlings or adult birds. At the two localities, fish was the main food of Audouin's gulls, with epipelagic prey (mainly clupeoids) being more important when both diurnal and nocturnal fisheries were operating. This confirms that epipelagic prey either caught actively by the gulls or linked to fisheries was particularly important in the feeding habits of Audouin's gulls. Nevertheless, differences between the two colonies appear mainly when only trawlers operated: while at the Ebro Delta gulls showed higher consumption of benthic-mesopelagic prey (probably linked to a higher trawler discard availability), gulls from the Chafarinas Islands consumed higher biomass of epipelagic prey probably caught actively at night. When both fleets operated around the two colonies, the average biomass of prey in a regurgitate of younger chicks was significantly higher at the Ebro Delta than at Chafarinas, and the opposite trend was recorded for older nestlings and adults. Niche width was broader in Chafarinas than in the Ebro Delta for both age classes and for any fishing fleet schedule, suggesting again that the exploitation of discards was higher at the Ebro Delta than at the Chafarinas, where gulls showed a more varied diet. Despite the fact that availability of discards was probably higher at the Ebro Delta than at Chafarinas, the per capita availability was not so different at both localities due to the increasing seabird community population at the Ebro Delta, which ca. doubled that at Chafarinas in the last decade.;English;Article;All Open Access, Gold, Green;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Spedicato

To this end, we developed a mass-balanced food-web model of a regional sea in the Northeast Atlantic, the Bay of Biscay (BoB), considering one of the most important anthropogenic disturbance in the area, the fishing pressure. The food-web model was performed for the whole BoB region for the first time. The model represents the ecosystems in the early 2000s, encompassing 120433 km2 between 0 and 1000 m depth. The model was composed of 52 functional groups, ranging from primary producers to top predators, and considering both Spanish and French fishing fleets. Input data included biomass obtained locally from bottom trawl and acoustic surveys, data from stock assessment, official fishery statistics, published and unpublished data on stomach content analyses and the use of empirical equations to estimate consumption and production rates. Our results highlight the importance of the pelagic domain, since the main trophic flows are determined by the interaction between phytoplankton, zooplankton and forage fishes. The role of the detritivore pathway was also relevant due to the relatively high abundance of detritivores organisms and the large percentage of primary production flowing to the detritus. Forage fish have resulted to be a key compartment fostering the connectivity between the benthic and pelagic domains. Pelagic sharks, dolphins, anglerfish, large hake and large demersal fishes were identified as potential keystone functional groups in the BoB model. The results also showed an intense exploitation by fisheries in early 2000s. Different strategies between Spanish and French fleets were also found. French fleets were mainly focussed on low trophic level forage fish (e.g., sardine and anchovy) and had larger impacts on higher trophic levels, while Spanish fleets mostly focussed on higher trophic level forage fishes (e.g., mackerel, horse mackerel and blue whiting) but also targeting sardine and anchovy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Therefore, it is of great importance to characterize the impacts of bottom trawling on bentho-demersal communities, which can be done through the study of indicators sensitive to trawling pressure. Using a functional indicator applied to 54 underwater video transects, we mapped the sensitivity to trawling of epibenthic invertebrates and fish communities in the Celtic Sea. We determined the relative influence of environmental and fishing variables on sensitivity and traits distribution. Our results suggest that community sensitivity to trawling is mainly driven by a spatial gradient of depth and primary productivity that separates the area into two main regions: a shallow, productive area, with low sensitivity and a higher abundance of swimming and crawling organisms, and a deeper, less productive area, with higher sensitivity due to a higher abundance of fixed, filter-feeding organisms. Fishing intensity also drives the sensitivity of communities confirming that they have already been shaped by a long history of mixed fisheries.

In this study, the effects of 15, 25, and 35 cm high cloth tarpaulin rigged between the lead line and the net were investigated in reducing the discard amount of trammel nets for red mullet (Mullus barbatus) in the south-eastern Black Sea. During the study, twenty fishing trips were carried out on-board a commercial vessel between May 11 and June 20, 2018. Results showed that there were no significant differences in the amount of discards between the commercial and experimental nets (P>0.05) However, cloth tarpaulin mounted nets (CTMN) were found to be significantly successful to reduce the amount of shore crab (Liocarcinus depurator) and the veined rapa whelk (Rapana venosa) (P<0.05). Although it is insignificant, a decline of capture was also observed in the amount of target species in CTMN compared to the commercial net (CN). Finally, the advantages and concerns of this gear modification, and potential reasons for the reduction of target and discard species are discussed. © 2021, Central Fisheries Research Inst.

In this study, we assessed the communication calls (whistles) that common bottlenose dolphins emit during their foraging activities in the absence and presence of motor boats and during dolphin depredation on trawlers, in Alghero (Sardinia, Italy) and Cres-Lošinj Archipelago (Croatia). The latter behaviour involves foraging on concentrated food sources during very noisy human activity and may require the emission of distinctive whistles. Thus, we investigated if whistle structure, in terms of frequency and time parameters, changes depending on these three foraging contexts. In Sardinia, during foraging in interaction with trawlers, whistles differed from those emitted during the other foraging contexts. Conversely, in Cres-Lošinj, significant variations in whistles were found to be related mainly to the presence of motor boats. This study represents the first report on how two dolphin populations adopt different acoustic tactics in the context of similar foraging behaviour.

However, the critical gaps in scientific knowledge associated with these impacts on untargeted but functionally important species remain to be filled. This is notably the case for a great proportion of discarded invertebrates, for which only a handful of studies have investigated their survival. In this study, 600 individuals from six different benthic invertebrate species were collected in commercial conditions in the Bay of Biscay for short-term survival experiments. Overall, the observed survival after 100–130 h and the predicted survival via mixture models were very high (>93%) for Asterias rubens, Aphrodita aculeata, Buccinum undatum and Pagurus sp. Survival of Maja brachydactyla was lower though still high (>80% overall) and Atelecyclus undecimdentatus was more vulnerable to trawling and handling, with ~50% of survival. Both showed 100% mortality when presenting carapace cracks and survival of M. brachydactyla was lower when missing appendages. No biotic nor abiotic parameters were correlated to survival, except injury class for M. brachydactyla and A. undecimdentatus. This study shows an overall high survival but highlights the fact that otter trawl fisheries may differentially affect discarded benthic invertebrates, therefore bringing light for future studies on longer-term impacts on benthic communities and coastal ecosystems.

The fisheries associated with the spiny lobster are mainly conducted with tangle nets, trammel nets, pots, and creels. The fishing pressure has greatly reduced their numbers, changing them from a common shallow coastal species to a largely remnant population. The relative research on the species' biology and fisheries from the eastern Mediterranean Sea is almost absent. The fishery along the Chalkidiki Peninsula, Greece, is multispecies, and fishing is conducted by a small number of artisanal fishermen mainly using trammel nets. The lobster stock-both spiny and clawed lobsters-declined significantly during the late 1980s and early 1990s, later than most cases in the Mediterranean Sea. However, data regarding the nature and status of the fishery associated with the spiny lobster in Greece are lacking. Data regarding the characteristics of the spiny regional fishery were obtained by interviews and questionnaires. Additionally, fishery surveys were conducted during the main lobster fishing season from 1 May 2017 to 31 August 2017. Sixteen species were identified (15 finfish species and one invertebrate species) as targeted. In total, 79 spiny lobsters were sampled in this study;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Haddock is an important commercial species widespread in the North Atlantic, but few studies related to quality have been carried out on this species. We studied the levels of external damages on haddock captured with a demersal trawl in the Northeast Atlantic. Further, we investigated to what extent the compulsory sorting grid and diamond mesh codend gear configuration employed in this trawl fishery is responsible for the external damages observed during the capture process. We evaluated external damages on 563 haddock captured over 22 hauls. In general, the results showed that catching haddock without any gear inflicted damages using demersal trawls is challenging. However, the results also showed that the severity of most damages is low and the probability to catch haddock with no external damage can be significantly increased removing the grid and changing codend design. © 2020 The Authors;English;Article;All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Thorpe

Benthic and demersal fauna from circalittoral soft bottoms have been studied using a benthic dredge (BD) (8 sampling stations) and an otter trawl (OT) (8 sampling stations on a seasonal basis). Some sediment and water column variables, as well as the trawling activity, have also been studied and used for analysing their linkage with the fauna. A total of 287 species have been found in these bottoms and fish, molluscs and crustaceans represented the most diverse and abundant faunistic groups. A new record of the decapod Hippolyte leptometrae for Spanish waters is also included in this study. Some multivariate analyses using BD samples indicated the presence of three assemblages, but these seem to represent different facies of a single benthic community due to the absence of acute sediment changes and significant differences in the fauna. OT samples only displayed differences related to seasons but not to sediment types or depth. These seasonal differences seem to be linked to biological and ecological features of both dominant and/or commercial species. Mud and organic matter contents (%OM) in sediment, as well as the temperature, were the main variables linked to the spatial distribution of the benthic community identified with BD, whereas medium and coarse sand as well as gravel contents were the main variables linked to the changes of the epibenthic and demersal assemblage resulting from OT samples.

The abundance and biomass of commercial species collected in this study do not seem to be high, which could be a result of the overfishing experienced in the Bay of Málaga by several fishing fleets (trawling fishing fleet, purse-seine fishing fleet and artisanal fishing fleet) (Baro et al., 2015).

To this end, a partial ecosystem model for three key pelagic species in the Northeast Atlantic (Norwegian spring-spawning herring, mackerel and blue whiting) is developed and coupled with an economic model describing harvesting behavior of three major exploiters. We explore the effects on the fishery under assumptions on plausible interaction parameters between the harvested species and the type of management adopted by the exploiting countries. Single-species management is modeled by using three single-species models of the pelagic complex. Net present value is increased by over 20% when applying multispecies management in the cooperative case. Under non-cooperation there is always overfishing of all species compared to the global optimum, resulting in depletion of the mackerel stock and an almost 50% loss in net present value attainable from the aggregate fishery. Interestingly, under non-cooperation the effect of exploiters applying either single-species or multispecies management is rather small on the health of the stocks and on economic benefits. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.;English;Article;;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Thorpe

In this paper, the demersal fisheries of the Ionian Sea [Geographic Sub-area (GSA) 19] were analyzed with respect to their spatial, temporal, economic, and biological characteristics in terms of four key species for fisheries, namely European hake, red mullet, giant red shrimp, and deep-water rose shrimp.

A wide range of statistical analysis methods were applied to fishery data in an attempt to distinguish factors that influence the species discard composition. While such approaches are important, they are still incomplete for disaggregating the economic and spatial-temporal factors for analyzing of this process and obtain a whole view of this issue. Our study aims to fill this gap by identifying, describing, and quantifying factors that influence discards of trawl fisheries using a multivariate approach based on five complementary aspects: “economic”, “vessel characteristics”, “spatial”, “temporal” and “environmental”. In addition, a spatial multi-criteria approach were used to investigate discard hot-spot areas using ecological criteria such as vulnerability and resilience of the discarded species. Using these ecological criteria will concentrate conservation efforts on the most relevant sites minimizing discards of a variety of potentially vulnerable species. This approach was applied to a case study of a multi-species demersal bottom trawl fisheries in north Spain, Cantabrian Sea (ICES area VIIIc). Results showed how spatial and economic factors highly affect species discard composition, identifying specific spatial-temporal discard hot-spots to be preferentially avoided by fishers. Mitigation measures for future fisheries management strategies should be implemented at multiple stages of the discarding process, both in the selection of the fishing grounds and the economic valorization of the discarded species. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd;English;Article;;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Thorpe

Optical and acoustic measurements made in the water column indicate a significant trawling-induced resuspension mainly due to the scraping action of doors. It manifests as a highly dynamic turbid plume confined near the seabed, where suspended sediment concentrations can reach 200 mg l-1. Concentration levels measured behind an “alternative” configuration (trawls with jumper doors instead of classical doors penetrating the sediment) are significantly lower (around 10–20 mg l-1), which indicates a potential limiting impact regarding the seabed. Grain size analyses of the surficial sediment led to highlight a potential reworking influence of bottom trawling. On the intensively trawled zone, this reworking manifests as an upward coarsening trend in the first 5 cm of the cores. A significant decrease in mud content (30 %) has been also witnessed on this zone between 1967 and 2014, which suggests an influence on the seabed evolution. The geometric analysis of bottom tracks (4–5-cm depth, 20-cm width) observed with a benthic video sledge was used to compute an experimental trawling-induced erosion rate of 0.13 kg m-2. This erosion rate was combined with fishing effort data, in order to estimate trawling-induced erosion fluxes which were then compared to natural erosion fluxes over the Grande-Vasière at monthly, seasonal and annual scales. Winter storms control the annual resuspended load and trawling contribution to annual resuspension is in the order of 1 %. However, results show that trawling resuspension can become dominant during the fishing high season (i.e., until several times the natural one in summer). In addition, the contribution of trawling-induced resuspension is shown to increase with water depth, because of the rapid decay of wave effects. Finally, the seasonal evolution of the respective contributions for erosion (mainly trawling and waves) could be mapped for the whole study area. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.;English;Article;All Open Access, Green;Scopus;4.3;CS - Western Waters;1,000-5,000;multidecadal;0-5;subday;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;Box core and trawl - sampling of sediment plume;NA;2;2;3;Results suggest that bottom trawling can become the main factor of resuspension in intensively trawled zones of the GV during calm periods (i.e. high season of fishing during summer period). However, the annual mass of sediment eroded by bottom trawling only represents around 1% of total mass resuspended by winter storms over the most intensively trawled area of the GV (i.e. between 90 and 120 m depth). The ratio between natural and anthropogenic resuspensions remains dependent on the erosion parameters selected for the natural flux computation, and the setting up of a validated full 3D model including effects of trawling and respecting different bottom circulation schemes in winter when storm waves occur and in summer when fishing effort is maximum should allow a final conclusion on the trawling contribution to sediment fluxes and balance in the Bay of Biscay.;NA;4.3;Field experiment;Physical_habitats;Mixed;NA;Mixed;sand _ mud;Physical disturbance of the seabed;NA;fishing intensity;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;Otter trawl;unclear;resuspension flux;Other;Positive;Otter trawling increases resuspension rate.

In addition to a standard boxcorer for common macrofauna, a Triple-D dredge was used to collect longer-lived, more sparsely distributed infauna and epifauna. Multivariate analysis did not reveal any difference between the assemblages in and outside OWEZ with respect to abundance, biomass, and production after a 5-year closure. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index pointed to a significantly higher diversity in OWEZ compared with some of the reference areas. A minority of the bivalve species assumed to be sensitive to trawling showed higher abundances (Spisula solida) or larger sizes (Tellina fabula, Ensis directus) in OWEZ than in some of the reference areas. In general, samples collected with the Triple-D showed more differences between areas than boxcore samples. No evidence was also found that the species composition in OWEZ relative to the reference areas had changed in the period between 1 (2007) and 5 (2011) years after closure. The change observed in all areas between 2007 and 2011 was mainly due to relatively small variations in species abundances. In conclusion, 5 years after the closure of OWEZ to fisheries, only subtle changes were measured in the local benthic community, i.e. a higher species diversity and an increased abundance and lengths of some bivalves. Depleted adult stocks, faunal patchiness, and a limited time for recovery (5 years) might explain that a significant recovery could not be found. The current study shows that designation of large-scale marine protected areas as planned for the North Sea will not automatically imply that restoration of benthic assemblages can be expected within a relatively short period of years. © International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2014.

In addition to a standard boxcorer for common macrofauna, a Triple-D dredge was used to collect longer-lived, more sparsely distributed infauna and epifauna. Multivariate analysis did not reveal any difference between the assemblages in and outside OWEZ with respect to abundance, biomass, and production after a 5-year closure. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index pointed to a significantly higher diversity in OWEZ compared with some of the reference areas. A minority of the bivalve species assumed to be sensitive to trawling showed higher abundances (Spisula solida) or larger sizes (Tellina fabula, Ensis directus) in OWEZ than in some of the reference areas. In general, samples collected with the Triple-D showed more differences between areas than boxcore samples. No evidence was also found that the species composition in OWEZ relative to the reference areas had changed in the period between 1 (2007) and 5 (2011) years after closure. The change observed in all areas between 2007 and 2011 was mainly due to relatively small variations in species abundances.

A monitoring programme was set up to study the populations in the NTZ and in a reference area east of Gotland where the fishing pressure was high. The programme included fishing with multimesh survey nets, modelling of potential larval export and estimation of fish consumption by large marine predators. Overall, the results showed a clear positive effect of the NTZ on turbot Scophthalmus maximus, with higher densities in the closed area compared with the fished area and also higher densities after closure compared with before. The NTZ also had older individuals and a more even sex ratio. This, in combination with a high potential for larval export from the NTZ to Gotland, shows that the marine reserve may be important for maintaining a viable S. maximus stock at Gotland. Also, for flounder Platichthys flesus, the densities were higher in the NTZ compared to the reference area and there was a net larval export to the fished area. For both species, density-dependent growth was evident, with a lower length at age in the closed area. Potential predation by grey seal Halichoerus grypus and great cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo sinesis on flatfishes, that could hamper the evaluation of the marine reserve, was also addressed. Taken together, the results show that there are clear benefits of the fishing ban for both flatfish species within the NTZ, while the net effects on fisheries are difficult to quantify. © 2013 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.;English;Article;;Scopus;None;CS - Baltic Sea;50,000-100,000;five year;10,000-50,000;year;Regular Fisheries Independent Survey;gillnets - 36 stations;ANCOVA (T=covariate) _ hydrodynamic model _ lagrangian dispersion;2;2;3;For both species of flatfish (turbot and flounder) density-dependent growth was evident, with a lower length at age in the closed area.

Few studies have examined the impacts of these fisheries on the reproductive potential of exploited fish species within the marine reserves. This study evaluated the potential impact of artisanal fishing on the reproduction of coastal fish species in a Mediterranean MPA through onboard sampling from January 2008 to December 2010. Eleven sex-changing fish species constituted an important part of the catch (20% overall and up to 60% of the total gill net catch) and, in five of them, most individuals were of one sex. Artisanal fishing can negatively affect the sustainability of those coastal fishes showing sex reversal, particularly the protogynous ones such as Diplodus cervinus and Epinephelus marginatus, as well as the species with complex mating systems (e.g. some sparids, labrids and scorpaenids). In all species the average size for the individuals captured was above the minimum landing size (where this exists), but in four species (Conger conger, Diplodus puntazzo, Sphyraena spp. and Sparus aurata) it was below the size of first maturity (L 50). Results show that sex and size selection by artisanal fishing not only can have an impact on the reproduction of coastal fish species but may also be exacerbating rather than reducing the impact of fishing on coastal resources. Thus, new management actions need to be urgently implemented in the MPAs where artisanal fisheries are allowed to operate in order to protect the reproductive potential of these species, particularly those showing a complicated reproductive strategy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.;English;Article;;Scopus;None;Mediterranean - non CS;10,000-50,000;two year;1,000-5,000;two week;Fisheries Dependent Data;self-sampling from artisinal fishermen and observers;recording sex status and size at sexual maturity;2;2;2;Results show that sex and size selection by artisanal fishing not only can have an impact on the reproduction of coastal fish species but may also be exacerbating rather than reducing the impact of fishing on coastal resources.

The nets used in bottom trawl fisheries cause mortality of benthic invertebrates and this can decrease the long-term availability of prey to exploited fish species by reducing the abundance of benthic invertebrates. This may have consequences for the sustainability of fisheries. 2. We assessed the impact of bottom trawling on the food availability of fish by comparing the condition of fish (as weight-at-length) in an area that had a steep commercial bottom-trawling gradient in the Irish Sea but otherwise homogeneous environmental conditions. 3. We found that the condition of the important commercial flatfish plaice Pleuronectes platessa was negatively related to trawling frequency, and this could be explained by a reduced production of the infaunal invertebrates they feed on. Density-dependent changes in competition over food could not explain this difference. No effect of trawling on the condition of the flatfish dab Limanda limanda was detected. Whiting Merlangius merlangus feeds primarily on fish, and therefore, no effect of bottom trawling on its condition was expected or detected. 4. This study therefore indicates that bottom trawl fisheries may have a negative effect on the condition of some of their target species, but not others, by reducing the abundance of their benthic prey. 5. Synthesis and application. Bottom trawls may indirectly affect the population size and growth rate of the target fish species and result in lower fishing yields.

The two areas were less than 2 km apart and close to a gas platform in the central Adriatic. Seabed morphology, sediment grain size, and macrobenthic community composition were investigated. There were clear physical effects on the seabed morphology, mostly as a consequence of the trawling passage. Strong and unequivocal signs of disturbance were not detected from the grain size analysis but there was a major spatial variability of sediment distribution. There were signs of stress in the macrobenthic community, i.e., reduction of complexity and diversity, increased variability of distributional patterns, and fewer large long-lived species in the fished area.;English;Article;;Scopus;4.3 _ 4.4;CS - Mediterranean;10,000-50,000;month;5,000-10,000;snapshot/no repeat sampling;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;Box core and trawl;PRIMER_ANOVA;2;1;2;Strong and unequivocal signs of disturbance were not detected from the grain size analysis but there was a major spatial variability of sediment distribution.

The former is among the most productive areas of the whole Mediterranean Sea, whereas the Balearic Islands is among the less productive ones in the western Mediterranean. The two areas also show different patterns in the bottom trawl fishing footprint. In the Alboran Sea, the fishing effort on the upper slope is much higher than in Balearic Islands. However, the opposite applies to the middle slope, the vast majority of it remaining unexploited in Alboran Sea, whereas a widespread fishery targeting blue and red shrimp Aristeus antennatus develops in Balearic Islands. Galeus melastomus is a small demersal shark species inhabiting slope bottoms, where adults and juveniles are segregated and concentrate in the middle and upper slope, respectively. It feeds intensively on mesopelagic preys which, in turn, feed on low trophic level organisms close to primary producers. In this work we aimed to study the effect of surface primary production on the condition of deep sea demersal communities. We compared the condition, diet and potential intra- and inter-species competition for feeding resources in the juveniles of G. melastomus between Alboran Sea and Balearic Islands. The comparisons of Le Cren's relative condition factor, and hepatosomatic and digestivosomatic indices evidenced an opposite pattern to that a priori expectable: better condition in the less productive area. The analysis of stomach contents showed similar diets in both areas, but lower food ingestion in Alboran Sea than in Balearic Islands. Different abundances of potential intra- and inter-specific competitors for feeding resources in the two areas, apparently linked to the different fishing footprints, seems the most likely explanation for the better nourished individuals in Balearic Islands. Whereas juveniles of G. melastomus dominate the shark community in the Balearic Islands upper slope, where the presence of adults of this species is almost negligible, in Alboran Sea this stratum is dominated by adults and potential competitors of other small demersal shark species. All shark species together, including G. melastomus, showed abundances 38% higher in Alboran than in Balearic Islands. Our results show that condition of deep sea demersal fish is ruled by complex inter-relationships among different factors, needing the combination of biological, ecological and fisheries knowledge to understand its variability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;Mediterranean - non CS;>100,000;two year;1,000-5,000;subday;Regular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;GAMs;2;2;3;NA;NA;None;Fisheries independent survey;Fish_cartilaginous;Sharks;NA;NA;Galeus melastomus;Catch_and_bycatch;Non-target;fishing effort;intra- and interspecific competition;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;NA;NA;Condition;Growth;Multiple;Our results also demonstrate that condition indices of deep sea sharks could be useful tools to assess deep sea ecosystems and their state of exploitation and conservation;Thuenen

We developed a framework to anticipate the cost-effectiveness of several fisheries management options, including space-time closures, gear selectivity improvements, and fishing effort reduction of eastern Ionian Sea fisheries. We also examined to what extent these fisheries could be influenced by placing new aquaculture sites into specific areas. We used a dynamic space-time model considering the effect of possible fishing effort displacement on alternative marine areas. A fine-scale distribution of 6 species of high commercial importance, for the eastern Ionian fisheries (central Mediterranean), was used together with the fishing effort distribution of trawlers, purse-seines, and small-scale fisheries to track the implications on several bio-economic indicators. The study revealed that the stocks and the fisheries economics benefited from a 10% reduction in fishing effort for all fishery sectors, while the unwanted fish catch was slightly higher. Thus, although there are notable advantages, this management option is not sufficient to support an EU regulatory framework aiming to promote more selective fishing practices and mitigate unwanted catches. However, we showed that the protection of juveniles, by imposing selectivity improvements or space-time closures on trawlers, slightly reduced the unwanted catch. Nevertheless, the benefit for the majority of stocks and fisheries economics, during the five-year simulation period, was limited. In the case of space-time closures, this is attributed to the offset due to the fishing effort displacement towards other areas. While the benefit on fish populations by improving trawl selectivity, it depends on the species. Finally, the establishment of new aquaculture units could lead to a slight re-allocation of fishing effort along the border of the new sites without substantially affecting the profit of small-scale fisheries. Such findings are useful for fisheries management and broader spatial planning in the Ionian Sea. They will provide insight to policymakers and different fishing sectors, thus enabling a more transparent and participatory decision–making process. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;CS - Mediterranean;>100,000;five year;500-1,000;month;Fisheries Dependent Data;NA;GAMs, LMM;2;2;3;NA;NA;4.4;Modelling/simulation;Foodweb;NA;NA;NA;Lophius budegassa _ Merluccius merluccius _ Trachurus trachurus _ Mullus barbatus _ Pagellus erythrinus _ Parapenaeus longiristris;Catch_and_bycatch;Target;fishing effort _ change in trawl selectivity _ fishing mortality;NA;Commercial;NA;NA;NA;Mortality;Mortality;Positive;The study revealed that the stocks and the fisheries economics benefited from a 10% reduction in fishing effort for all fishery sectors, while the unwanted fish catch was slightly higher. ...we showed that the protection of juveniles, by imposing selectivity improvements or space-time closures on trawlers, slightly reduced the unwanted catch.;Thuenen

As part of purse seine fishing for small pelagic fish in northern European waters, excess and/or unwanted catches are routinely released from the net in a process called slipping. Due to excessive crowding in the net prior to release, post-slipping mortality rates can be unacceptably high. Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) support large and economically important purse seine fisheries but are known to be particularly vulnerable to such crowding-induced mortality. Developing management advice to promote post-slipping survival for this species is currently challenging, due to a lack of understanding of how crowding influences their physiology. Here we examine the physiological response, recovery and survival of wild caught mackerel exposed to various degrees and durations of simulated crowding stress in a series of sea cage trials. The magnitude of the physiological response and its time to recovery was positively correlated with crowding density and duration and was characterized by cortisol elevation, energy mobilization and anaerobic metabolite accumulation. There were also indications of osmoregulatory disturbance. Skin injury and mortality rates showed a similar positive relationship to crowding density. The physiological disturbance was recoverable for most fish. Instead, the rate at which mortalities developed and the physiological profile of moribund fish indicated that skin injury, likely arising from abrasive contact with netting and other fish during crowding, was the probable cause of mortality. Injured fish also exhibited a loss of allometric condition relative to non-injured survivors. Crowding treatments were potentially confounded by differences in ambient oxygen reduction, water temperature and pre-treatment fish condition between trials, and densities were replicated only once. These results contribute to the development of welfare conscious fishing practices that aim to reduce post-slipping mortality. © The Author(s) 2021.;English;Article;All Open Access, Gold, Green;Scopus;NA;NE-Atlantic;05/Oct;day;05/Oct;two week;Other;In vitro tank experiments;GLS, GLM;2;2;3;NA;NA;None;Lab experiment;Fish_teleost;Pelagic;NA;NA;Scomber scombrus;Catch_and_bycatch;Target;crowding;NA;Commercial;Seines;Purse seine;NA;Mortality _ Injury;Mortality;Positive;The magnitude of the physiological response and its time to recovery was positively correlated with crowding density and duration and was characterized by cortisol elevation, energy mobilization and anaerobic metabolite accumulation.;Thuenen

Numerous studies are investigating the overall impact of marine litter to sea life and indirect to humans and the outcome shows that the problem is very complex. It has short term and long term negative effects, some of them are eventually still unknown, and therefore the latter has been seriously underestimated throughout the years. The present study targets to provide an overview of the spatial distribution and initial assessment of marine litter abundance in the Bulgarian sector of the Black sea waters as well as more precise classification of dominating litter categories to serve as basis for analysis of the current state and to lay down the foundation of more comprehensive marine litter monitoring. Combined stratified fish stock and marine litter assessment survey was carried out for three consecutive years (2015–2017) and results were analysed in terms of proper differentiation and classification of the marine litter items collected and the most frequent litter groups are identified accordingly. © 2020, Scibulcom Ltd..

Since the conservation of these species has become a priority, fishery scientists are faced with the challenge of reducing incidental catch, which entails high rates of mortality. Among the species threatened by fishing activities, the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) is a charismatic species considered as “vulnerable” at the global scale. In the Mediterranean Sea trawl nets are the gears with the highest probability of catching protected species incidentally. A new flexible Turtle Excluder Device (TED) was tested for the first time on commercial bottom trawlers to assess its effectiveness in reducing bycatch in the Mediterranean Sea. Analysis of the total catches of the hauls made with and without the TED showed that the difference in terms of weight was not significant. The catch of the main commercial species showed similar rates without a significant loss of size (i.e. total length) with the exception of the largest anglerfish (Lophius spp.). The bycatch of control nets included mostly rays and sharks, but never turtles, although the authors learned from the crews of other vessels operating in the same areas at the time of the trials that they had caught some loggerhead turtles. Our study demonstrates that TED scan be adopted without significantly affecting commercial catch. This informs fishers and managers for a practical and effective means that may reduce the bycatch of threatened species in coastal Mediterranean demersal multispecies fisheries. The measures involving gear modifications require significant investment but they are technically feasible and are capable of improving the conservation prospects of these endangered species. Besides ensuring normal earnings, the TED induced a significant reduction of debris and litter in the codend, thus reducing catch sorting time and improving catch quality. © 2019 Vasapollo et al.

The Ecopath with Ecosim modeling suite has been widely used to describe exploited marine systems and perform simulations over time. Pagasitikos Gulf is a shallow semi-enclosed gulf in the western coast of the central Aegean Sea that is characterized as semi-protected, with a bottom trawling ban in force since 1966. In this study, an Ecopath model was constructed including 31 functional groups (FGs) of organisms of lower to higher trophic levels, while Ecosim temporal simulations were run for 18 years (2008–2025), including the calibration period (2008–2017). An overall decrease in biomass and catch of the studied marine resources was observed by the end of the simulation period, due to environmental factors as well as fisheries exploitation. To examine the effect of fishing, three different scenarios were investigated, all aiming toward fishing effort reduction by 10, 30, and 50% compared to the initial business-as-usual scenario, applied to both fleets operating in the area (purse seiners and small-scale). All examined scenarios led to higher total biomass compared to the basic Ecosim simulation (the higher the reduction in fishing effort, the higher the increase in biomass), while catches were significantly lower in all cases as a result of less fishing. The most profound biomass increase with reduced fishing effort was observed in other larger pelagics, anchovy, anglerfish, sharks and rays, mackerels, hake and other gadiforms. In conclusion, reducing the exploitation levels of the ecosystem is a key factor that contributes to rebuilding of marine resources. © Copyright © 2019 Dimarchopoulou, Keramidas, Tsagarakis and Tsikliras.;English;Article;All Open Access, Gold;Scopus;NA;CS - Mediterranean;10,000-50,000;multidecadal;5,000-10,000;year;Regular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;EwE;2;2;3;NA;NA;4.4;Modelling/simulation;Foodweb;NA;NA;NA;NA;Catch_and_bycatch;Target;fishing effort;NA;Commercial;NA;NA;NA;Biomass;Abundance/biomass/density;Negative;All examined scenarios led to higher total biomass compared to the basic Ecosim simulation (the higher the reduction in fishing effort, the higher the increase in biomass), while catches were significantly lower in all cases as a result of less fishing.

The assessment was performed based on spatial data characterizing location and vulnerability of 5 relevant marine targets (e.g. seagrasses and coral beds), and the distribution of 17 human activities (e.g. trawling, maritime traffic) during a reference scenario 2000–2015. Moreover, projections for selected physical and biogeochemical parameters (temperature and chlorophyll ‘a’) for the 2035–2050 timeframe under RCP8.5 scenario, were integrated in the assessment to evaluate index variations due to changing climate conditions. The application of the CI-Index in the Adriatic Sea, showed higher cumulative impacts in the Northern part of the basin and along the Italian continental shelf, where the high concentration of human activities, the seawater temperature conditions and the presence of vulnerable benthic habitats, contribute to increase the overall impact estimate. Moreover, the CI-Index allowed understanding which are the phenomena contributing to synergic pressures creating potential pathways of environmental disturbance for marine ecosystems. Finally, the application in the Adriatic case showed how the output of the CI-Index can provide support to evaluate multi-risk scenarios and to drive sustainable maritime spatial planning and management. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.;English;Article;All Open Access, Green;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4.3;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Thuenen

For some species this mortality may be sufficient to cause population declines. The Baltic Sea is a global ‘hotspot’ for bird bycatch in gillnet fisheries and is globally important for wintering sea ducks, but no technical solution has been found yet to reduce bird bycatch in gillnet fisheries in the Baltic. Here, we report on trials conducted in the Baltic Sea to test whether two different gillnet modifications with visual stimuli can effectively reduce bird bycatch while maintaining volume of fish caught. We conducted paired trials of two types of visual stimuli attached to nets: 1)high contrast monochrome net panels and 2)net lights (constant green and flashing white LED lights). We measured the amount of fish and birds caught in standard nets and those modified with the visual stimuli. Neither of the two most commonly caught species, Long- tailed Ducks (Clangula hyemalis)and Velvet Scoters (Melanitta fusca), were deterred from lethal encounters with nets by either black-and-white panels or by steady green or flashing white net lights. Long-tailed Ducks were caught in larger numbers in nets equipped with flashing white net lights than in unmodified nets at the same location. Catch rates of commercial fish were not affected by net lights or net panels placed within the nets. Hence, while the deterrents that we tested successfully maintained fish catch, they failed to reduce bird bycatch and are therefore ineffective. We discuss likely avenues for future investigation of bycatch mitigation methods for gillnet fisheries, including species and location response to net lights, managed fishery closures, above-water distraction of birds and gear switching. © 2019 The Authors;English;Article;All Open Access, Gold, Green;Scopus;NA;CS - Baltic Sea;>100,000;year;NA;NA;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;Bootstrapped mean and Confidence interval;2;2;3;The authors conducted trials with high contrast panels and lights to reduce bird bycatch in the gillnet fisheries.

This study describes an approach to map the spatiotemporal distribution of bottom trawl discards taking into account on-board observer data, environmental information and high-resolution estimates of fishing effort derived from Vessel Monitoring System data. Two were the main objectives: i) mapping the Discards Per Unit Effort (DPUE: kg/h) and ii) mapping the total discards quantities (in kg) in a predefined spatial unit (grid cell of 5 × 5 km). For this purpose, discards data from commercial bottom trawlers (seasonal basis, period 2003–2006, 2008) operating on the continental shelf of the eastern Ionian Sea were analyzed. The DPUE for a) all species with Minimum Landing Size (MLS), b) all species without MLS and c) all fish species, were modeled by means of Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) using satellite environmental parameters, bathymetry and season as independent covariates. Mapping discards quantities in a predefined spatial unit was based on the spatial overlapping between GAM estimates for the year 2010 and fishing effort distribution for the same year. Spatial clusters of high discard quantities (hot spots) and their spatiotemporal persistence were also investigated. Results revealed how the environmental and temporal factors influence the DPUE distribution of each discard group and indicated increased discards quantities in areas of high fishing effort. The potential implications of the resulting DPUE maps for advancing discards spatial mitigation are further discussed. Mapping discards quantities using both the DPUE and the fishing effort distribution provide valuable insights that can be useful to investigate the broader ecosystem consequences of the EU landing obligation and other potential fishery management policies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;CS - Mediterranean;>100,000;five year;1,000-5,000;day;Fisheries Dependent Data;NA;GAMs;2;2;3;NA;NA;4.2;Modelling/simulation;Benthos;NA;NA;NA;NA;Catch_and_bycatch;Bycatch;fishing effort;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;Otter trawl;NA;DPUE (Discards Per Unit Effort);Abundance/biomass/density;Positive;Results revealed how the environmental and temporal factors influence the DPUE distribution of each discard group and indicated increased discards quantities in areas of high fishing effort.;Thuenen

These high biodiversity spots, represent also refugia for numerous demersal organisms from adverse environmental conditions and provide several ecosystem functions. Recently, the wide employ of Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) as standard tools for monitoring programs has shed light on the effects of the increasing human activities and global changes on these sensitive habitats. As a consequence, the impacts of different stress conditions on the slow-growing species of coralligenous communities have become more and more evident. In order to evaluate the status of deep coralligenous banks of Mediterranean Sea, a monitoring project was implemented to improve their knowledge, and to investigate on the principal issues characterizing these communities. In particular, ROV-video analysis revealed, among the main stressors, the increase of sediment resuspension and deposition probably due to trawl fishing, causing a decrease of coralligenous cover. The impact of this pressure leads to an overall loss of diversity and abundance, with changes in community structure and dynamics. Monitoring activities on large spatio-temporal scales are therefore very useful and needed to assess change patterns and to suggest appropriate management and conservation tools. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.;English;Article;;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4.3;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Thuenen
SW4_0455;E4;Eryasar A.R.;Effects of square-mesh codend on the benthic by-catch for the beam trawl fisheries of veined Rapa whelk, Rapana Venosa;2018;Acta Ichthyologica et Piscatoria;48;2;173;181;10.3750/AIEP/02359;;Background. The beam trawl fisheries of veined rapa whelk, Rapana venosa (Valenciennes, 1846), cause small benthic organisms to be captured and also damage the other species living on the seafloor. To solve this problem, a proper modification that minimise the by-catch should be designed and put into practice. This study aims to compare 72 mm commercial diamond-mesh codend with 72 mm square-mesh codend to reduce the benthic by-catch in this fishery. Materials and methods. Totally 15 hauls were carried out in south-eastern Black Sea Region within 10–14 August 2017. A commercial diamond-mesh and square-mesh beam trawls were towed simultaneously behind a commercial fishing vessel to compare the by-catch compositions. Paired t-test was used to compare the catch amount of two codends based on species. GLMM (Generalised Linear Mixed Models) was used to compare the length of captured veined rapa whelk, mussel, and crab species. Results. There was a 77-percentage-point reduction in the mean number of the captured individuals as by-catch in square-mesh codend when compared with commercial diamond-mesh codend and this difference was found statistically significant (P < 0.05). A total of 17 species was captured as by-catch in both codends. Comparing to diamond-mesh codend, the catch amount of the 13 by-catch species had decreased in square-mesh codend. Conclusions. In conclusion, the square-mesh codend was found successful in decreasing the by-catch amount of many benthic species except for flatfish species and large crabs. In addition to this, the veined rapa whelk amount fell by half and this means a 25-percentage-point profit decrease for fishermen. © 2018, Scientific Society of Szczecin.

Nearly one third (27.30%) of the individuals were quantified to ingest microplastics although there was no evidence of oxidative stress or cellular damage in the liver of fish which had ingested microplastics. A small increase in the activity of glutathione S-transferase (GST) of M. surmuletus was detected which could be suggesting an induction of the detoxification systems but these findings should be tested in laboratory conditions under a controlled diet and known concentration of microplastics. Fish from trammel fisheries, operating closer to land and targeting larger individuals, showed higher mean ingestion values than fish from trawling fisheries, and were related to body size, as microplastics ingested increased with total fish length. Consequently, ingestion values of microplastics were not related to sampling distance from land giving further evidence of the ubiquity of microplastics in the marine environment. Finally, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis showed that the vast majority of microplastics were filament type and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was the main identified component. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.;English;Article;;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4.5;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Thuenen

The reform of the European Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), which intends to ban discards through the landing obligation of all catches, may force seabirds to seek alternative food sources, such as baited hooks from longlines, increasing bycatch rates. To test this hypothesis we performed a combined analysis of seabird-fishery interactions using as a model Scopoli's shearwaters Calonectris diomedea in the Mediterranean. Tracking data showed that the probability of shearwaters attending longliners increased exponentially with a decreasing density of trawlers. On-board observations and mortality events corroborated this result: the probability of birds attending longliners increased 4% per each trawler leaving the longliner proximity and bird mortality increased tenfold when trawlers were not operating. Therefore, the implementation of the landing obligation in EU waters will likely cause a substantial increase in bycatch rates in longliners, at least in the short-term, due to birds switching from trawlers to longliners. Thus the implementation of the landing obligation must be carefully monitored and counterbalanced with an urgent implementation of bycatch mitigation measures in the longline fleet. © The Author(s) 2016.;English;Article;All Open Access, Gold, Green;Scopus;NA;Mediterranean - non CS;>100,000;decade;500-1,000;day;Data Storage, GPS, Acoustic Taggin;NA;GLMM, Pearson´s Chi-squared Test with Bonferroni correction;2;2;3;NA;NA;4.2;Fisheries dependent survey;Seabirds;NA;NA;NA;Calonectris diomedea;Catch_and_bycatch;Bycatch;Relative fishing effort (trawl vs. Longliners);NA;Commercial;Hooks_and_lines;Longline;NA;Mortality;Mortality;Positive;Tracking data showed that the probability of shearwaters attending longliners increased exponentially with a decreasing density of trawlers.

At least 30,000 to 40,000 turtles were caught along the Palestinian coastline during the 1920s to 1930s. Although intentional cap- ture of marine turtles is now illegal, sea turtles are still incidentally caught by the fishing industry, making it a major cause of sea turtle mortality. The present study as- sesses the impact of the Israeli fishery fleet on the turtle population in the Levantine basin based on on-board observations and a fishermen survey. The results show that gillnets and trawlers are the main threats to sea turtles in this area. 21 turtles were caught during 1385.5 hours of trawling observations - a catch rate of 0.015 turtles per hour. We estimate that a total of 1,315 turtles are caught annually by Israeli trawlers. According to the fishermen survey, ~21 turtles are caught each year by a single gillnet vessel, yielding an annual estimate of 1,672 turtles for the whole gillnet fleet. We have also found that only a small fraction of the turtles injured by trawlers is represented in the strandings. The mortality rate through trawling and the stranding density is the highest in the region, emphasizing the urgent need to regulate the Israe- li fishery.

In this study, we explore the effect of this widespread anthropogenic disturbance on the species richness of a benthic ecosystem, along a gradient of bottom trawling intensities. We use data from 80 annually sampled benthic stations in the Dutch part of the North Sea, over a period of 6 years. Trawl disturbance intensity at each sampled location was reconstructed from satellite tracking of fishing vessels. Using a structural equation model, we studied how trawl disturbance intensity relates to benthic species richness, and how the relationship is mediated by total benthic biomass, primary productivity, water depth, and median sediment grain size. Our results show a negative relationship between trawling intensity and species richness. Richness is also negatively related to sediment grain size and primary productivity, and positively related to biomass. Further analysis of our data shows that the negative effects of trawling on richness are limited to relatively species-rich, deep areas with fine sediments. We find no effect of bottom trawling on species richness in shallow areas with coarse bottoms. These condition-dependent effects of trawling suggest that protection of benthic richness might best be achieved by reducing trawling intensity in a strategically chosen fraction of space. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;CS - North Sea;>100,000;five year;50-100;month;Regular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;SEM (Structural Equation  model - a multivariate analysis of networks of causal relationships);2;2;3;NA;NA;4.3;Fisheries independent survey;Benthos;NA;NA;NA;NA;Catch_and_bycatch;Bycatch;Trawl disturbance intensity;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;Beam trawl;NA;Benthic species richness;Biodiversity;Negative;Our results show a negative relationship between trawling intensity and species richness.

Between 10 and 33% of the colonies in unprotected populations were partially colonized by epibionts, most likely following tissue injury, whereas only 4 to 10% of the populations in a marine protected area were affected. Populations that were simultaneously exposed to fishing as well as intensive SCUBA diving showed the highest proportion of colonization. Colonies with approximately 30 to 35% of epibiont coverage showed significantly lower numbers of gonads per polyp. Similarly, concentrations of lipids were lower in females with epibionts, thus indicating allocation of resources into recovery of injured tissue instead of reproduction. Furthermore, whereas unaffected colonies showed a uniform distribution of carbohydrates and proteins through apical branches to more central ones, colonies with epibionts had significantly lower protein concentrations in branches that are positioned 3 branching order levels closer to the stem.

This work focused on analysing the distribution of eggs and larval stages of some fishery-targeted taxa (Coris julis, Epinephelus spp., Sciaena umbra and Scorpaena sp.) whose adult abundances and/or biomass are higher in the reserve and therefore would be likely to show gradients of larval abundance attributable to the existence of the Marine Protected Area (MPA). Oceanographic data indicated there was water column stratification, horizontal distribution of surface water masses and hydrodynamic features linked with Mediterranean seasonality. During the summer sampling, eggs and larvae of targeted fish taxa were mainly located in the northeast of the MPA, near the coast. An effect of depth and current was demonstrated for Coris julis and Epinephelus spp. and there appears to be an offshore gradient for the other targeted taxa, especially for the egg stages. These data highlight the fact that the Cabrera archipelago is a potential important spawning area for targeted fishery species. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;Mediterranean - non CS;50,000-100,000;year;500-1,000;year;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;Kruskal Wallis;2;2;1;NA;Higher egg abundance and production inside an MPA could also come from other causes than exclusion of fishing;None;Fisheries independent survey;Fish_teleost;Demersal;NA;NA;Epinephelus spec;Catch_and_bycatch;Bycatch;MPA;NA;Unknown;NA;NA;NA;Egg abundance;Production/productivity;Positive;Kruskal–Wallis multiple comparison tests on abundance of Epinephelus spp. eggs demonstrated trends similar to C. julis, with higher values within MPA, in Upstream / MPA / Downstream comparison (H = 18.44, df = 2, P < 0.001) and in North / MPA / South and in East / MPA / West comparisons (H = 17.25, df = 2, P < 0.001 and H = 18.986, df = 2, P < 0.001, respectively).;Thuenen

SW4_1310;E4;Brotons J.M., Munilla Z., Grau A.M., Rendell L.;Do pingers reduce interactions between bottlenose dolphins and nets around the Balearic Islands?;2008;Endangered Species Research;5;02/Mar;301;308;10.3354/esr00104;;The artisanal gillnet fishery around the Balearic Islands is experiencing a growing problem with bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus depredating the bottom-set nets. The resulting catch loss engenders hostility from fishers, and interactions between dolphins and nets can result in bycatch mortality. One potential mitigation measure is the placement of acoustic alarms, or pingers, on the nets. However, as pingers have produced mixed results in studies of their effectiveness in other fisheries, direct evidence is needed on whether they will be effective in this fishery. We report on a large-scale experimental trial in which 59 different vessels from the artisanal fleet were each equipped with identical nets, and each vessel was assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: no pinger, inactive pinger or active pinger. Three brands of pinger were tested. During the trial, data on fishing operations were recorded by onboard observers. A total of 1193 fishing operations were observed. We analysed 2 response variables, the presence or absence of evidence that dolphins had interacted with the net, and standardized yields, using generalized linear mixed models. Overall net interaction rates were reduced by 49% with active pingers, but not all pinger brands were equally effective. Yields, measured as profit per unit effort, were increased by 9% in the active-pinger condition, but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.592). Our results suggest that pingers in the artisanal fisheries of the Balearic Islands reduced the rate of net interaction, but further study is required given dolphins' potential for habituation. © Inter-Research 2008.;English;Article;All Open Access, Bronze, Green;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4.2;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Thuenen

Monitoring of littoral fish assemblages (0-30 m depth) in this zone began one year after the MPA was set up. The survey was conducted at 6 stations, located inside and outside the MPA, using three methods: underwater visual census (UVC) on transects, UVC using a new fish assemblage survey technique (FAST), and experimental net fishing performed by a fisherman.

One aspiration of the ecosystem approach to management is to conserve function as well as biodiversity, but trawling impacts on benthic community function need to be understood before they can be managed. Here we present the large scale and long term impact of chronic trawling on the functional composition of benthic invertebrate communities using a comprehensive set of functional traits. The effects of chronic trawling disturbance on the functional composition of faunal benthic invertebrate communities, as sampled with a small beam trawl, were investigated at 6 to 13 sites in each of 4 contrasting regions of the North Sea. Each site was subject to known levels of trawling disturbance. Information on the life history and ecological function traits of the taxa sampled was translated into fuzzy coding and used to analyse the relationship between life history and functional roles within the ecosystem. Multivariate analyses were used to examine changes in the distribution of traits over gradients of trawling intensity. Changes in the functional structure of the community due to the effects of long-term trawling were identified in 3 of the 4 areas sampled. Filter-feeding, attached and larger animals were relatively more abundant in lightly trawled areas, while areas with higher levels of trawling were characterised by a higher relative biomass of mobile animals and infaunal and scavenging invertebrates. Univariate analysis of selected traits confirmed the patterns observed in multivariate analysis. These results demonstrate that chronic bottom trawling can lead to large scale shifts in the functional composition of benthic communities, with likely effects on the functioning of coastal ecosystems. © Inter-Research 2006.;English;Article;All Open Access, Bronze, Green;Scopus;NA;CS - North Sea;>100,000;five year;10,000-50,000;five year;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;Fuzzy Correspondence Analysis;3;3;3;NA;NA;4.3;Fisheries independent survey;Benthos;Benthic_epifauna;Other;Mixed;Epifauna;Physical disturbance of the seabed;NA;Trawling intensity;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;Otter trawl;NA;Functional composition;Community composition;Multiple;This study indicates that there are effects of chronic bottom trawling disturbance on the functional composition of marine invertebrate communities at the scale of the fishery across a range of habitats.

In the absence of effort controls, fishing vessels displaced from a closed area will impact fish populations and the environment elsewhere. Based on the observed response of the North Sea beam trawl fleet to the closure of the ""cod box"" and an existing size-based model of the impacts of beam trawling, we predict the effects of seasonal area closures on benthic communities in the central North Sea. We suggest that repeated seasonal area closures would lead to a slightly more homogeneous distribution of annual trawling activity, although the distribution would remain patchy rather than random. The increased homogeneity, coupled with the displacement of trawling activity to previously unfished areas, is predicted to have slightly greater cumulative impacts on total benthic invertebrate production and lead to localized reductions in benthic biomass for several years. To ensure the effective integration of fisheries and environmental management, the wider consequences of fishery management actions should be considered a priori. Thus, when seasonal closures increase the homogeneity of overall disturbance or lead to the redistribution of trawling activity to environmentally sensitive or previously unfished areas, then effort reductions or permanent area closures should be considered as a management option. The latter would lead to a single but permanent redistribution of fishing disturbance, with lower cumulative impacts on benthic communities in the long run. © 2003 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

In contrast to the expected positive effects, yield and spawning stock biomass have decreased. The effects of the plaice box are evaluated by analyzing the relevant factors and processes (natural and anthropogenic) that affect recruitment. It is shown that the Dutch beam trawl effort has decreased in two phases. During 1989-1993, when the plaice box was closed only during the second and third quarter, effort was reduced to around 40% of the original level. When the box was also closed in the fourth (1994) and first quarter (1995 onwards), effort decreased to around 6%. The effort reduction would imply a reduction in discard mortality if all other factors had remained constant. However, a reduced growth rate and possibly a higher rate of natural mortality may have counteracted the reduction in fishing effort. The apparent changes in growth and mortality coincided with changes in the North Sea ecosystem that occurred in the early 1990s but may also be related to a response to the change in beam trawl effort.

Data were collected during two commercial fishing regimes: (1) trawling and purse seine fisheries, and (2) diurnal trawlers only. Since the food supply for the gulls in this area was heavily reliant on the activity of purse seine fisheries, these contrasting situations allowed us to analyze short-term effects, induced by daily changes in food supply, on niche width, dietary shift, and niche overlap between the two species. Overall, both species relied mainly on fish for food, especially Clupeiforms, in the case of Audouin's gull irrespective of the fishing situation, and in the case of the yellow-legged gull, only when purse seine fishing was in operation. When purse seine boats did not operate (food shortage), yellow-legged gulls broadened their niche, consuming equal amounts of all the feeding resources, and they showed a dietary shift toward a greater consumption of prey from refuse tips. In contrast, Audouin's gulls did not change their niche width, but showed a slight dietary shift away from the consumption of epipelagic fish, compensated by an increase in reliance on benthic-mesopelagic resources. Niche overlap was clearly higher on days when both fishing fleets operated, probably because a super-abundant food resource facilitates high overlap without affecting coexistence between the two species. Since our study was developed on the basis of daily variations in food supply, and competition effects are to be expected on a longer-term basis, these changes can be seen as the outcome of the coexistence of two species in stable competitive equilibrium.;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;Mediterranean - non CS;10,000-50,000;two year;1,000-5,000;two year;Stomach Contents Analyses;NA;G Test _ Mann Whitney U Test;2;2;2;NA;NA;4.4;Other;Seabirds;NA;NA;NA;Larus;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, the continuous increase in fisheries in the last few decades has led to the overexploitation of their main commercial stocks. Using fishery-independent data collected under the framework of the MEDITS trawl surveys carried out over the last 20 years, we study the demersal fish diversity pattern in the Mediterranean at a large spatial and temporal scale to determine whether it is being affected by the general fishing overexploitation of the demersal resources. The detected diversity trends are compared with the spatio-temporal variation in bottom trawl fishing effort in the Mediterranean. Our results show a stability and even recovery of demersal fish diversity in the Mediterranean together with higher diversity values on the continental shelves of the Balearic Islands, Sardinia, Sicily and the Aegean Sea. At large temporal and spatial scales, the high diversity of demersal assemblages in the Mediterranean is associated with a reduction in bottom trawl fishing effort. The inclusion of species other than target ones through diversity indices is important in the implementation of an ecosystem-based fisheries management. © 2019 CSIC.;English;Article;All Open Access, Gold, Green;Scopus;NA;CS - Mediterranean;>100,000;multidecadal;10,000-50,000;year;Regular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;Linear regression;3;3;3;At large temporal and spatial scales, the high diversity of demersal assemblages in the Mediterranean is associated with a reduction in bottom trawl fishing effort;NA;4.4;Fisheries independent survey;Fish_teleost;Demersal;NA;NA;NA;Catch_and_bycatch;Target;fishing effort;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;Otter trawl;NA;diversity;Biodiversity;Negative;NA;Tsagarakis

Here, signs of recovery following the enforcement of regulations are increasingly being reported. We examined the extent to which biological diversity and functionality are restored when fishing pressure is reduced by evaluating changes in species biomass and that of the main functional groups present in the continental platform, as obtained from systematic survey (IBTS) results. Moreover, we examined how this recovery is mirrored in the trophic organization of the affected communities by assessing variations in link density and strength of the main consumer species and investigating whether variations in species richness were paralleled by changes in network properties. Finally, we investigated whether reductions in fishing pressure (fishing mortality) were correlated with the abovementioned variations in community and trophic structure of the bentho-demersal assemblages. Our results corroborate the apparent recovery of North Atlantic fishing stocks and further substantiate the improved welfare of the bentho-demersal assemblages of the Southern Bay of Biscay. Specifically, we found an increase in species richness and in the abundance of most functional groups, especially those more closely related to the benthos, following the reduction in fishing mortality. Increases in overall species richness were paralleled by an increase in the number of links and a reduction in mean interaction strength connecting the main consumer species with their prey items. This is in accordance with ecological theory and could explain the mechanism by which bentho-demersal assemblages restructure their trophic network towards more stable organizations. Synthesis and applications. Detecting patterns of recovery or change to alternative stable states following stress release is essential to unravel the effects of perturbations and to design effective management strategies. Our study shows that trophic network properties provide a convincing tool to evaluate and perceive recovery patterns.

This area is important ecologically and economically because it supports a commercial stock of Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus), and a nursery ground for European hake (Merluccius merluccius), as well as being subjected to high levels of fishing pressure. Here, Italian and Croatian bottom trawl fisheries mainly target Norway lobster while impacting juvenile hake. Single-species stock assessments for the target species indicate fluctuating trends between 2006 and 2013, as do the survey biomass trends of most of their prey, underlining the need for a multispecies management plan. The diet of the target species were examined and prey items partitioned into four groups. Consumption of prey groups by predators was modelled using a Holling Type II functional response. A modified biomass dynamic model was used to represent the prey dynamics, projecting them into the future for 10 years (2013-2022) and testing different management strategies, including a discard ban. The most effective management option was the protection of larger individuals, which led to a clear improvement in the stock abundance and spawning stock biomass of both hake and Norway lobster without significant adverse effects on their prey. The discard ban scenario appeared to have knock-on effects on both predators and some of their prey. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;CS - Mediterranean;>100,000;five year;5,000-10,000;year;Regular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;MICE;2;2;3;NA;NA;4.4;Modelling/simulation;Fish_teleost;Demersal;NA;NA;Merluccius merluccius;Catch_and_bycatch;Target;fishing mortality;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;Otter trawl;NA;abundance _ spawning stock abundance;Abundance/biomass/density;Negative;NA;Tsagarakis

The discard ban scenario appeared to have knock-on effects on both predators and some of their prey. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;CS - Mediterranean;>100,000;five year;5,000-10,000;year;Regular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;MICE;2;2;3;NA;NA;4.4;Modelling/simulation;Benthos;Benthic_epifauna;Other;Unknown;Nephrops norvegicus;Catch_and_bycatch;Target;fishing mortality;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;Otter trawl;NA;abundance _ spawning stock abundance;Abundance/biomass/density;Negative;NA;Tsagarakis

Species were collected with van-Veen grabs and beam trawls. Trophic position (i.e. nitrogen stable isotope ratios, d15N) and energy flow (i.e. species metabolism approximated by body mass scaled abundance) of dominant species were compared in trawled areas and an area protected from fisheries for 14months in order to detect trawling cessation effects by trophic characteristics. At the community level, energy flow was lower in the protected area, but we were unable to detect significant changes in trophic position. At the species level energy flow in the protected area was lower for predating/scavenging species but higher for interface feeders. Species trophic positions of small predators/scavengers were lower and of deposit feeders higher in the protected area. Major reasons for trophic changes after trawling cessation may be the absence of artificial and additional food sources from trawling likely to attract predators and scavengers, and the absence of physical sediment disturbance impacting settlement/survival of less mobile species and causing a gradual shift in food availability and quality. Our results provide evidence that species or community energy flow is a good indicator to detect trawling induced energy-flow alterations in the benthic system, and that in particular species trophic properties are suitable to capture subtle and short-term changes in the benthos following trawling cessation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.;English;Article;All Open Access, Green;Scopus;NA;CS - North Sea;10,000-50,000;year;100-500;half year;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;statistical testing;2;2;3;NA;stable isotope analysis and energy flow;4.3 _ 4.4;Other;Benthos;Benthic_infauna;NA;Sand;NA;Physical disturbance of the seabed;NA;presence/absence of trawling;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;Beam trawl;Solea solea _ Pleuronectes platessa;community energy flow;Trophic structure;Positive;NA;Tsagarakis

The samples used in this study were collected in bottom trawl surveys between 36 and 779 m depth. Generalized linear models, linear regression, cluster and similarity percentage analyses, and generalized additive models were used to compare the two areas. Twenty-nine elasmobranch species were caught, 12 of them common to both areas, 7 appearing only in the Balearic Islands, and 10 only in Algeria. The bathymetric distributions of species were, in most cases, best fitted to uni-modal response curves. The models for species common to both areas showed similar bathymetric trends, except for Etmopterus spinax, which in Algeria showed a maximum abundance located 154 m shallower than in the Balearic Islands. Four bathymetric assemblages were identified in both areas with similar depth ranges but with different species composition. The mean values of the community descriptors were higher on the shelf in the Balearic Islands, whereas higher values were detected on the slope in Algeria. Different between-area bathymetric trends for all the descriptors were detected, with the exception of mean fish weight. The distinct environmental scenarios and fishing histories of the areas studied are discussed as underlying traits influencing the elasmobranch populations.;English;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Nevertheless, a significant decrease in the median lengths over time was depicted for N. norvegicus and Parapenaeus longirostris. A decreasing trend in the total mortality (Z) and exploitation rates (E) with time was only observed for Mullus barbatus. An overexploitation condition was shown by P. longirostris and Merluccius merluccius during time while a moderate overexploitation was detected for M. barbatus and Aristaeomorpha foliacea over time.

During the study period 1985-2006, a total of 365 species (41 cephalopods, 76 crustaceans, 33 chondroichthyes and 215 osteichthyes) were collected in the investigated area from 10 to 4000 m, updating the faunal lists of this area with 18 new records and one alien species for the Mediterranean. An increase in the species richness was observed throughout the study period. The historical analysis showed a low abundance of chondroichthyes and significant increases over time for cephalopods, crustaceans and osteichthyes during the study period 1985-2006.An increasing trend in density over time was also detected for some target species (Illex coindetii and Nephrops norvegicus) and an inverse significant correlation with the fishing effort was also shown. Nevertheless, a significant decrease in the median lengths over time was depicted for N. norvegicus and Parapenaeus longirostris. A decreasing trend in the total mortality (Z) and exploitation rates (E) with time was only observed for Mullus barbatus. An overexploitation condition was shown by P. longirostris and Merluccius merluccius during time while a moderate overexploitation was detected for M. barbatus and Aristaeomorpha foliacea over time. A state of almost equilibrium and an optimal exploitation were observed for N. norvegicus and Aristeus antennatus, respectively. The authors give rise to discussion on the fishing effort-exploitation rate-recruitment process to explain the trends shown in the north-western Ionian Sea. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;CS - Mediterranean;50,000-100,000;multidecadal;5,000-10,000;half year;Regular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;Correlation;2;2;2;NA;NA;4.4;Fisheries independent survey;Fish_teleost;Demersal;NA;NA;Mullus barbatus;Catch_and_bycatch;Target;fishing effort;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;Otter trawl;NA;Exploitation rate;Mortality;Positive;Spearman = -0.711;

Sampling was by annual lobster trammel net fishing, an experimental technique used inside the CIMR, and on-board commercial operations in adjacent fishing grounds. We examined trends in combined fish abundance and biomass (catch per unit effort), species richness and diversity, size structure, trophic level and species composition of the community. Our results showed the CIMR fish community continued to change throughout the study period as (1) abundance and biomass increased, (2) mean body size and trophic level increased and (3) species composition changed according to a linear model. Relative to nearby fished areas the CIMR fish community had (1) higher abundance and biomass, (2) lower species diversity and higher taxonomic distinctness, (3) larger relative body size and (4) no difference in mean trophic level. We found clear evidence of spillover of fish from the CIMR to the adjacent fishery as commercial fish yields at the MPA border (<0.5 km from the boundary) increased continuously during the study period, despite being locally depleted due to fishing effort concentration (fishing the line). Furthermore, fish size and diversity at the border were intermediate between the CIMR and other fished zones, suggesting that this is a transitional zone influenced by this MPA. Our results show that changes in community abundance, biomass, size structure and species composition provide a clear and interpretable view of MPA recovery.

SW4_1676;E4;Skov H., Durinck J.;Seabird attraction to fishing vessels is a local process;2001;Marine Ecology Progress Series;214;;289;298;10.3354/meps214289;;Seabird aggregation and scavenging around fishing vessels is widely assumed to be a major component of seabird ecology. However, few field data have shown the relative importance of human fishing activities in comparison with the distribution of marine habitats and the availability of natural food sources. Here we perform a spatial analysis of the relative influence of fishing activities, by modelling observed density gradients of working trawlers and attracted seabirds along PCA-derived large scale gradients in hydrographic variables and abundance of small herring Clupea harengus, from shallow estuarine waters to deep oceanic waters across the Baltic Sea-North Sea interface. Ail hydrographic and biological data, including numbers of attracted seabirds, were collected synoptically from a ship sampling systematically throughout the region. The analysis indicates that a relatively small degree of overlap exists between the spatial distribution of fishing vessels and that of potentially scavenging seabirds. Gradients in the abundance of seabirds attracted to the ship indicate responses to hydrographic features such as upwelling zones and fronts, and gradients in the supply of natural foods such as schools of immature herring, rather than responses to changes in the supply of discards from fishing vessels. Estimates of the scale of attraction of seabirds by the research ship further indicate that attraction in the Baltic Sea-North Sea gradient is a local (<10 km) process. The small-scale nature of the attraction of seabirds to ships in the region is further tested by displaying observations of trawlers and attracted seabirds obtained from separate cruises in relation to observed salinity and pycnocline characteristics. We suggest that in similar heterogeneous environments at least, attraction of seabirds by trawlers is predominantly a result of local processes. Our results illustrate that the importance of human fisheries in seabird ecology cannot be assessed without detailed knowledge of seabirds' dependence on natural food sources and habitats.;English;Article;All Open Access, Bronze;Scopus;NA;North Sea - non CS;>100,000;five year;5,000-10,000;year;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;Correlation;2;2;3;the concurrence of fisheries and potentially scavenging seabirds is limited;NA;4.4;Fisheries independent survey;Seabirds;NA;NA;NA;Larus canus _ Larus argentatus _ Larus marinus _ Rissa tridactyla _ Fulmarus glacialis;Discarding;NA;presence of fishing vessels;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;Otter trawl;NA;Attraction of seabirds;Behaviour;No impact;NA;Tsagarakis

The practice of discarding by-catch, under-sized fishes and offal from trawlers has led to an increase in the populations of certain scavenging bird species. The greatest population increases have occurred in the most aggressively competitive species, while some subordinate species have decreased in abundance. Several recent studies indicate that a similar situation may exist for epibenthic scavengers. We explore the possibility that enhanced food supply in the form of fisheries-generated carrion may affect the competitive balance between sympatric populations of hermit crabs, Pagurus bernhardus and P. prideaux. Under normal conditions, both species have overlapping diets and occur in equal abundance at the site studied. In laboratory investigations both species consumed the same types of carrion. However field observations revealed that while P. bernhardus aggregate in areas disturbed by trawls where they consume animals damaged in the trawl path, P. prideaux do not. Morphometric analyses revealed that P. prideaux have smaller chelae relative to P. bernhardus. Thus, P. prideaux may avoid dense aggregations of P. bernhardus which are more aggressive.

Since 2009 Kosterfjord has been included in the Marine Protected Area Kosterhavet National Park. To effectively manage national parks, long-term time series of ecological data are needed and those can be derived from local sediment archives. In this study we present multiproxy geochemical (bulk TOC, C/N and heavy metals) and micropaleontological (dinoflagellate cysts, selected palynomorphs and benthic foraminifera) data from a sediment core taken in the southern part of the Koster Trench. Radiometric dating by 210Pb and 137Cs shows that the core archived the environmental changes that took place between 1988 and 2012. The TOC, heavy metals and foraminiferal indices indicate mainly high to good Ecological Quality Status, with moderate ecological quality for arsenic concentrations. Dinoflagellate cysts suggest a major change occurring in the upper water column around 2002. The cysts of Pentapharsodinium dalei peak around 1992 and show overall slightly higher relative abundances between 1988 and 2002. Increased abundance of Biecheleria baltica cysts, heterotrophic species, oligotrichids, pollen and spores characterise the upper core part deposited from 2002 to 2012. Also, there is a clear increase of Alexandrium cysts in the top of the core (~2008–2012). Benthic foraminifera show a major faunal change reflected in a significant increase of agglutinated species (mainly Textularia earlandi) from 2007 towards present day, while the lower part of the core (1988–2007) is dominated by calcareous species. Overall, the changes demonstrated by the dataset suggest an increased freshwater input or a higher river/land runoff, as supported by climatic and hydrographical data showing increased precipitation over the study area, decreasing salinity, and an increasing trend in particulate organic carbon in the surface waters. These changes, in combination with trawling activities, which have been moved to the deepest part of the trench since 2009, seem to favour dinoflagellate and benthic foraminiferal species with mixotrophic and omnivorous feeding strategies. Similar to the dinocysts, calculated foram-AMBI and NQIforam indices show a shift around 2002 suggesting that environmental changes occurring in the study area are likely linked to darkening of coastal waters. © 2021 The Author(s);English;Article;All Open Access, Hybrid Gold;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;North Sea - non CS;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4.3;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Uhlmann_Reid

Surveys were conducted on 734 an-glers, some in the government fisheries office during the licence request and others during the fishing activity. Shore angling is practised throughout the year, mostly at weekends and during day time, and with an increase in summer. More than 60% of the anglers are unemployed, have low incomes, and spend on average €254 per person per year on this activity, adding up to a total of €1.16 million per year. Shore angling average number of fishing days per year per fisher was 65.1±62.0 and the average catch per unit of effort was 0.35±0.26 kg/angler/hour. The estimated total annual catch was 520.7 t. Forty-three teleost species, 2 elasmobranchs and 6 invertebrates were identified in the catches. Despite the limitations and inaccuracies inherent to the surveys, they still provided valuable information and gave a general perception of the recreational shore fisheries in Madeira. The possible impact on the most captured species, such as the white seabream, Diplodus sargus (Linnaeus, 1758), and the parrotfish Sparisoma cretense (Linnaeus, 1758), should be analysed because high fishing pressure could affect populations and ecosystems. © 2020 CSIC.;English;Article;All Open Access, Gold;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;None;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Uhlmann_Reid

This study aims to evaluate the type and density of marine litter in two shallow fishing grounds in the NW Mediterranean Sea, both belonging to the Natura 2000 network. Moreover, it quantifies the fraction of marine litter within the total catch to help understand the potential influence of marine litter on fisheries. Two study areas were selected, one in the vicinity of urban populated areas and high navigational traffic and one in a rural site off an agricultural area. The urban area had more benthic marine litter (393 to 198 kg km-2) including clinker (residue from coal-burning steamships), fabric, plastics, and processed wood and accounting for up to 38% of the total catch. The rural area had far less marine litter (34–56 kg km-2), accounting for only 5% of the total catch. Marine litter may have potential negative effects on fisheries;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

During the spring-summer period between 2012 and 2015, 41 Chondrichthyes, including 18 sharks (5 orders and 11 families), 22 batoids (3 orders and 4 families) and 1 chimaera, were detected from several geographical sub-areas (GSAs) established by the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean. Batoids had a preferential distribution on the continental shelf (10-200 m depth), while shark species were more frequent on the slope (200-800 m depth). Only three species, the Carcharhiniformes Galeus melastomus and Scylio-rhinus canicula and the Torpediniformes Torpedo marmorata were caught in all GSAs studied. On the continental shelf, the Rajidae family was the most abundant, being represented in primis by Raja clavata and then by R. miraletus, R. polystigma and R. asterias. The slope was characterized by the prevalence of G. melastomus in all GSAs, followed by S. canicula, E. spinax and Squalus blainville. Areas under higher fishing pressure, such as the Adriatic Sea and the Spanish coast (with the exception of the Balearic Islands), show a low abundance of chondrichthyans, but other areas with a high level of fishing pressure, such as southwestern Sicily, show a high abundance, suggesting that other environmental drivers work together with fishing pressure to shape their distribution. Results of generalized additive models highlighted that depth is one of the most important environmental drivers influencing the distribution of both batoid and shark species, although temperature also showed a significant influence on their distribution. The approach explored in this work shows the possibility of producing maps modelling the distribution of demersal chondrichthyans in the Mediterranean that are useful for the management and conservation of these species at a regional scale.

The analysis of the change in community structure is also conducted based on the factors of environment and fishing. The results show that 280 species had been caught, 222 of which are fish species. The abundance varies dramatically annually. Diversity has a general uptrend. Cluster and MDS show that the fifteen years could be divided into three groups of 2001-2003, 2004-2011 and 2012-2015. STARS of Discriminating species shows that there are two regime shift of the Atlantic herring in 2004 and 2014, which regime shift indexes (RSIs) are -0.45 and 0.41. There are two regime shifts of the haddock in 2003 and 2012, which RSIs are -0.58 and -0.66. There is one regime shift of the sprat in 2014, which RSI is 2. Through the analysis of environmental factors and fishing factors, we find that the first change of community structure is mainly affected by fishing factors. The second change of community structure is mainly affected by environmental factors. © 2019, Editorial Office of Haiyang Xuebao.

A fleet of about 73,000 vessels is widespread along the Mediterranean coasts. Artisanal activities are predominant in South Mediterranean and in the eastern basin, while trawling features GSAs in the western basin and the Adriatic Sea. The overall landings of fish, crustaceans and cephalopods, after peaking during mid 90s at about one million tons, declined at about 700,000 tons in 2013. However, while landings are declining in EU countries since the 90s, in non-EU countries a decreasing trend was observed only in the last 5–10 years. The current levels of fishing effort determine a general overexploitation status of commercial stocks with more than 90% of the stock assessed out of safe biological limits. Indicators obtained from available ecosystem models were used to assess the sustainability of the fisheries. They included primary production required to sustain fisheries (PPR), mean trophic level of the catch (mTLc), the loss in secondary production index (L index), and the probability of the ecosystem to be sustainably exploited (psust ). In areas exploited more sustainably (e.g., Gulf of Gabes, Eastern Ionian, and Aegean Sea) fishing pressure was characterized by either low number of vessels per unit of shelf area or the large prevalence of artisanal/small scale fisheries. Conversely, GSAs in Western Mediterranean and Adriatic showed very low ecosystem sustainability of fisheries that can be easily related with the high fishing pressure and the large proportion of overfished stocks obtained from single species assessments. We showed that the current knowledge on Mediterranean fisheries and ecosystems describes a worrisome picture where the effect of poorly regulated fisheries, in combination with the ongoing climate forcing and the rapid expansion of non-indigenous species, are rapidly changing the structure and functioning of the ecosystem with unpredictable effects on the goods and services provided. Although this would call for urgent conservation actions, the management system implemented in the region appears too slow and probably inadequate to protect biodiversity and secure fisheries resources for the future generations. © 2017 Colloca, Scarcella and Libralato.;English;Review;All Open Access, Gold, Green;Scopus;NA;CS - Mediterranean;>100,000;multidecadal;5,000-10,000;month;Fisheries Dependent Data;NA;Modelling;2;2;2;Our analysis show that differences in fisheries productivity between different areas can be largely explained by differences;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Surveys were conducted in 9 major fishing locations along the Black Sea coast (from Istanbul to Artvin) between December 2008 and December 2011. Data provided from to the fishing operations have shown that bycatch rates as the proportion of bycatch weight to total catch weight were calculated as 30% for gill nets, 37% for purse seines, 62% for trawls and 19% for hydraulic dredges. Bycatch rates in number of fish basis were also detected as 34% for gill nets, 11% for purse seines, 62% for trawls and 23% for hydraulic dredges. All figures indicate that there is rather high impact of fishing gears on exploited stocks causing growth and recruitment overfishing. It is very important to reduce bycatch rates for sustainable fisheries by using more selective fishing methods. As a result of the comprehensive surveys, some practical management advices was provided for the fisheries management authority in order to increase selectivity of the gears and reduce bycatch rates for the sustainable of the living resources in the Black Sea. © Published by Central Fisheries Research Institute (CFRI) Trabzon, Turkey.;English;Article;All Open Access, Bronze;Scopus;NA;Black Sea;>100,000;two year;50,000-100,000;month;Fisheries Dependent Data;NA;CPUE analysis;2;2;3;NA;NA;None;Fisheries dependent survey;Fish_teleost;Demersal;NA;NA;Mixed assemblage;Catch_and_bycatch;Bycatch;gear type;NA;Commercial;NA;NA;NA;Abundance;Abundance/biomass/density;Multiple;Mixed;Uhlmann_Reid

We used high-resolution spatial and temporal data on porpoise abundance and fishing effort from the Danish Skagerrak Sea to identify areas with potentially higher and lower risk of porpoise bycatch. From May 2010 to April 2011, 4 commercial gillnet vessels were equipped with remote electronic monitoring (REM) systems. The REM system recorded time, GPS position and closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage of all gillnet hauls. REM data were used to identify fishing grounds, quantify fishing effort and document harbour porpoise bycatch. Movement data from 66 harbour porpoises equipped with satellite transmitters from 1997 to 2012 were used to model population density. A simple model was constructed to investigate the relationship between the response (number of individuals caught) and porpoise density and fishing effort described by net soak time, net string length and target species. Results showed that a model including both porpoise density and fishing effort data predicted bycatch better than models containing only one factor. We therefore conclude that porpoise telemetry or REM data allow for identification of areas of potential high and low bycatch risk, and better predictions are obtained when combining the 2 sources of data. The final model can thus be used as a tool to identify areas of bycatch risk. © Inter-Research 2016.;English;Article;All Open Access, Green;Scopus;NA;Baltic Sea - non CS;>100,000;year;1,000-5,000;day;Fisheries Dependent Data;NA;Poisson GLM;2;2;3;This implies that the number of por poises caught was directly proportional to the soak;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, a discard ban has been proposed as necessary in Europe to ensure the sustainability of the seas. It is of crucial importance for the management and conservation purposes to study the potential consequences of a discard ban on the foraging ecology of threatened seabirds. We assessed the influence of fishing activities on the feeding habits of 22 male and 15 female Audouin's gulls (Larus audouinii) from the Ebro Delta (Mediterranean Sea) during the breeding period using GPS loggers together with Stable Isotope Analysis (SIA), which provided new insights into their foraging behavior and trophic ecology, respectively. GPS data revealed different sex-specific foraging patterns between workdays and weekends. Females were highly consistent in that they foraged at sea throughout the week even though discarding stops at weekends. In contrast, males switched from foraging at sea during the week (when discards are produced) to an increased use of rice field habitats at weekends (when fishermen do not work). This sex-specific foraging behavior could be related to specific nutritional requirements associated with previous egg production, an energetically demanding period for females. However, on a broader time scale integrated by the SIA, both sexes showed a high degree of individual specialization in their trophic ecology. The need to obtain detailed information on the dependence and response of seabirds to fishing activities is crucial in conservation sciences. In this regard, sex-specific foraging behavior in relation to fisheries has been overlooked, despite the ecological and conservation implications. For instance, this situation may lead to sex differentiation in bycatch mortality in longlines when trawlers do not operate. Moreover, any new fisheries policy will need to be implemented gradually to facilitate the adaptation of a specialized species to a discard ban scenario. © 2015 The Authors.

Beam-trawling is a source of physical disturbance to marine sedimentary communities in areas less than 50m deep, on the western European continental shelf. Chains attached between the beam-trawl shoes are designed to penetrate the upper few cm of the sediment, which leads to the damage or removal of some infaunal and epifaunal species. In some areas, beam-trawling may be frequent and intense, leading to speculation that it may generate long-term changes in the local benthic fauna. 2. As part of a larger MAFF study examining the ecological effects of beam-trawling, we investigated its local impact on an infaunal community in the north-eastern Irish Sea. Studies of this type are complicated by the heterogeneity of the environment, hence we adopted a replicated, paired control and treatment design to maximize the chances of detecting any effects due to trawling. 3. A side-scan sonar survey revealed that the experimental area was characterized by mobile megaripples in the south-eastern sector of the experimental area and stable sediments with uniform topography in the north-western sector. Multivariate analysis of the species abundances from the control areas separated the fauna into two distinct communities which corresponded to the different substratum characteristics. Data from the two regions were therefore treated separately when testing for the effects of trawling. 4. In the north-western sector, trawling led to 58% decrease in the mean abundance of some taxa and a 50% reduction in the mean number of species per sample. Multivariate analysis revealed that differences between control and fished sites were largely due to the reduction or removal of less common species. These effects were less apparent in the mobile sediments of the south-eastern sector, which had a naturally impoverished fauna and high level of heterogeneity. 5. Univariate variables, such as abundance and the total number of species per sample, indicated that the variation between replicate samples increased as a result of trawling disturbance. However, examination of the community data using an index of multivariate dispersion revealed no difference between fished and unfished areas.

Despite an experimental regime of biannual fishing, no changes in the number or size of serpulid tubeheads was apparent throughout the course of the study, and no significant changes were detectable in the composition of the tubehead fauna that could be attributed to fishing disturbance. A laboratory study revealed that tubeheads were unlikely to resettle on the seabed in an orientation similar to that prior to disturbance. Serpulids are known to be opportunistic species and may rapidly recolonise disturbed areas, such that we were unable to detect these changes within our sampling regime. Serpulid tubeheads provide an important microhabitat, a total of 73 taxa (50 species) being associated with them. Other similar studies indicate that these associated organisms are important food for small fish. In addition to increasing benthic biodiversity, they provide a potentially important habitat for juvenile commercial species, providing shelter and food.;English;Article;NA;NA;NA;CS - Western Waters;1,000-5,000;two year;Oct/50;half year;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;Tukey-Kramer test _ anova _ Primer _ ANOSIM _ SIMPER;2;2;3;NA;NA;4.3;Field experiment;Benthos;Benthic_infauna;Other _ Serpulids;Mixed;Serpulidae;Physical disturbance of the seabed;Non-target;Fishing effort;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;NA;Beam trawl;number of tube heads;Abundance/biomass/density;No impact;No significant change;Uhlmann_Reid

A commercial fishing vessel, using conventional otter trawling gear, fished two waylines repeatedly until each had been disturbed entirely either once or twice. Infaunal samples were collected from replicate sites located within the fished and adjacent undisturbed control areas. Univariate analyses of species richness and diversity indicated that the infaunal community did not alter during the first 102 h after fishing in the area that was trawled once. However, the abundance of a number of species decreased significantly on the unfished line compared with the fished line 150 h after fishing. No differences were detected on the line that was fished twice, but this part of the experiment was terminated after 72 h. Multivariate analyses revealed that the communities in both fished and unfished areas changed in a similar manner through time and that there was no apparent effect of fishing until 150 h after fishing. These short-term changes are discussed in the light of recent studies of infaunal changes in other habitats. © 2000 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.;English;Conference Paper;All Open Access, Bronze;NA;NA;Mediterranean - non CS;1,000-5,000;month;Oct/50;snapshot/no repeat sampling;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;0.1 m2 van Veen grab;anova _ Primer _ ANOSIM _ SIMPER;2;2;3;NA;NA;4.3;Field experiment;Benthos;Benthic_infauna;NA;Mud;polychaetes _ crustaceans _ molluscs;Physical disturbance of the seabed;Non-target;Fishing effort;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;NA;Otter trawl;Benthic community structure;Abundance by taxon;No impact;No significant change;Uhlmann_Reid

One of the most pervasive signs of intensive fishing is ""fishing down the food web"", with landings increasingly dominated by smaller species from lower trophic levels. Decreases in the trophic level of landings are assumed to reflect those in fish communities, because size-selective mortality causes decreases in the relative abundance of larger species and in mean body size within species. However, existing analyses of fishing impacts on the trophic level of fish communities have focused on the role of changes in species composition rather than size composition. This will provide a biased assessment of the magnitude of fishing impacts, because fishes feed at different trophic levels as they grow. Here, we combine body size versus trophic level relationships for North Sea fishes (trophic level assessed using nitrogen stable-isotope analysis) with species-size-abundance data from two time-series of trawl-survey data (whole North Sea 1982-2000, central and northern North Sea 1925-1996) to predict long-term trends in the trophic structure of the North Sea fish community. Analyses of the 1982-2000 time-series showed that there was a slow but progressive decline in the trophic level of the demersal community, while there was no trend in the trophic level of the combined pelagic and demersal community. Analyses of the longer time-series suggested that there was no trend in the trophic level of the demersal community. We related temporal changes in trophic level to temporal changes in the slopes of normalised biomass size-spectra (which theoretically represent the trophic structure of the community), mean log2 body mass and mean log2 maximum body mass. While the size-based metrics of community structure showed long-term trends that were consistent with the effects of increased fishery exploitation, these trends were only correlated with trophic level for the demersal community. Our analysis suggests that the effects of fishing on the trophic structure of fish communities can be much more complex than previously assumed. This is a consequence of sampled communities not reflecting all the pathways of energy transfer in a marine ecosystem and of the absence of historical data on temporal and spatial changes in the trophic level of individuals. For the North Sea fish community, changes in size structure due to the differential effects of fishing on species and populations with different life histories are a stronger and more universal indicator of fishing effects than changes in mean trophic level.";English;Article;;Scopus;NA;CS - North Sea;>100,000;multidecadal;50,000-100,000;year;Regular Fisheries Independent Survey;Tissue samples for trophic level;Mann–Whitney;2;3;3;NA;NA;4.4;Fisheries independent survey;Fish_teleost;Demersal;NA;NA;Most demersal fish teleost and alsmobranch;Catch_and_bycatch;Target & non-target;None;NA;Commercial;NA;NA;NA;trophic level;Trophic structure;Negative;Multiple;Uhlmann_Reid

The survey focused on those fishing vessels whose base port was in the archipelago and, hence, the catch of South-eastern Spain longliners moving in summer to the archipelago was not considered. The fishermen's perception was that the stock of loggerhead turtles is declining in the archipelago and that fishing activities are at least partially responsible for this trend. The observer reports indicated that the figures produced by the interviewees for catch per unit effort (CPUE) were reliable. Therefore, on the basis of these figures we calculated a total catch of 373 (95% CI: 365-308) loggerheads for 2001.

Macroscopic modifications of the seabed morphology were assessed by sidescan sonar. Alterations of the sediment texture and changes in macrobenthic infauna were assessed using a box-corer. The most obvious modifications of the seabed were trawl tracks caused by the passage of trawl doors through the sediments. Ephemeral but significant changes in the sediment composition were observed. Changes in the benthic assemblage were detected only 48 h after experimental trawling. The clearest changes were detected in the molluscan component.

Fishers exploiting a sedentary stock are likely to visit the most profitable (highest catch rate) areas first. Such spatial targeting of fishing effort is likely to have important consequences for stock monitoring and assessment. We used underwater television surveys of Nephrops burrow densities on the Farn Deeps grounds, northeast England, to describe changes in abundance and distribution between the beginning and end of a winter fishing season. Above a threshold of c. 0.6 burrows m–2, overwinter depletion increased with burrow density, consistent with fishing effort being targeted at the highest densities. A simple simulation model showed that this pattern of mortality is an expected consequence of spatially targeted fishing behaviour. The model also predicted that there is decreased spatial variability in density after fishing. An overall decrease in variability was not evident from the survey data, but geostatistical analysis indicated that there was “flattening” of the density profile along a north-south axis, consistent with the dominant direction of commercial trawling. We concluded that Nephrops fishers are able to find and exploit the highest densities of their target species. A potential consequence is that catch per unit effort (CPUE) data used to monitor trends in this stock potentially could mask declines in stock abundance. CPUE might be more effective if analysed at finer spatial scales, but this is not currently possible. In the absence of these fine scale commercial data, fishery-independent surveys (e.g., underwater television) are an important source of information on trends in stock abundance. © 2005, Copyright Taylor &amp;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Methods for assessing the effects on target stocks are generally well developed, but methods for assessing the effects on other components and attributes of the ecosystem are not. Area closures and effort controls are widely used fishery management tools that affect the distribution of fishing effort and may therefore have consequences for a range of species and habitats. An approach is developed to predict the effects of area closures and effort control on the biomass, production, and species richness of benthic communities in the North Sea. The redistribution of beam trawling effort as a result of management action was modelled with a random utility model, assuming that fishers selected fishing grounds on the basis of their knowledge of past catch rates. The effects of trawling on benthic invertebrates were predicted using a size-based model that accounted for differences in habitat among fishing grounds. Our simulations demonstrated that closures of different sizes and in different locations could have positive or negative effects on benthic communities. These predicted effects resulted from the trade-off between recovery in the closed areas and additional trawling effects in the open areas that arose from displaced fishing activity. In the absence of effort controls, closure of lightly fished areas had the strongest positive effect on benthic communities. Effort reduction also had a positive effect. Therefore, area closures in lightly fished areas, coupled with effort reduction, are expected to minimize the effects of fishing on benthic communities. As it was not possible to access full international data for the North Sea beam trawl fleet, the results of the analyses are illustrative rather than complete. Nevertheless, what is demonstrated is an effective approach for assessing the environmental consequences of fishery management action that can be used to inform management decision-making as part of an EAF. © 2006 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.;English;Article;NA;NA;NA;CS - North Sea;>100,000;year;50,000-100,000;snapshot/no repeat sampling;Fisheries Dependent Data;Benthos ecological model;Random Utility Model (RUM) _ correlation _ principal axis approaches;2;2;3;NA;NA;4.3;Fisheries dependent survey;Benthos;Benthic_infauna;NA;Mixed;modelled benthic community;Physical disturbance of the seabed;Non-target;Fishing effort;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;NA;Beam trawl;Benthic community structure;Community composition;Negative;area closures in lightly fished areas, coupled with effort reduction, are expected to minimize the effects of fishing on benthic communities;Uhlmann_Reid

By-catch of commercially valuable fish, particularly flatfish species, has always been a matter of concern. The amount of by-catch comprising fish and invertebrates may actually be high, but figures discussed in public are biased by including discarded undersized shrimp, the target species, and dead material. Many changes in the equipment and practices of the fishery have occurred through the decades. As a result, the overall balance between consumption shrimp, by-catch and undersized shrimp has changed in a positive sense. Those fish still taken as by-catch despite the use of more selective trawls are often discarded and no longer landed for reduction purposes, leaving a chance to survive. Their species spectrum is largely stable over time. In this paper, detailed considerations are made in the particular case of North Sea plaice (Pleuronectes platessa L.), which are abundant in the by-catch and is a commercially important species. Any large numbers discarded must be regarded in the light of high numbers of offspring, the large discards of the flatfish fishery and the high natural mortality of juvenile plaice. From that the conclusion is drawn, that the German shrimp fishery meets criteria of sustainability in respect to the target species and by-catch situation. © 2010 The Authors.

The proposed indicator is based on the biological traits composition of epifaunal species that determine vulnerability to trawling: mobility, fragility, position on substrata, average size and feeding mode. Five groups defined by the combination of these biological traits represented different levels of vulnerability to trawling. Results based on analysis of the relative abundance of these groups at each site showed that the biological traits significantly reflected ecosystem disturbance, with the less disturbed communities having the highest abundance of groups considered vulnerable to trawling. According to these findings a Trawl Disturbance Index (TDI) was proposed as a tool for fisheries managers to assess the ecosystem health. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, disturbance of benthic communities by trawling may compromise ecosystem service delivery, including fisheries' catches. In this work, we explore 1) the impact of trawling activities on benthic functional components (after the BTA approach) and 2) how trawling impact may affect the ecosystem services delivered by benthic communities. To this aim, we assessed the provision of ecosystem services by adopting the concept of Ecosystem Service Providers (ESP), i.e. ecological units that perform ecosystem functions that will ultimately deliver ecosystem services. We studied thirteen sites subjected to different levels of fishing effort in the Mediterranean. From a range of environmental variables included in the study, we found ESPs to be mainly affected by fishing effort and grain size. Our results suggested that habitat type has significant effects on the distribution of ESPs and this natural variability influences ESP response to trawling at a specific site. In order to summarize the complex relationships between human uses, ecosystem components and the demand for ecosystem services in trawling grounds, we adapted a DPSIR (Drivers-Pressures-State Change-Impact-Response) framework to the study area, emphasizing the role of society as Drivers of change and actors demanding management Responses. This integrative framework aims to inform managers about the interactions between all the elements involved in the management of trawling grounds, highlighting the need for an integrated approach in order to ensure ecosystem service provision. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.;English;Article;NA;NA;NA;CS - Mediterranean;>100,000;five year;1,000-5,000;snapshot/no repeat sampling;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;Van Veen Grabs;PERMANOVA _ PRIMER;2;1;2;NA;NA;4.4;Fisheries independent survey;Benthos;Benthic_epifauna_infauna;NA;NA;trait based benthic communities;Catch_and_bycatch;Non-target;Fishing effort;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;NA;Otter trawl;Benthic community structure;Community composition;Multiple;Multiple;Uhlmann_Reid

Unlike ordinary cast nets, it is used in deep waters from shallow up to 140 meters for catching whiting (Merlangius merlangus euxinus). In this study, important findings were obtained about the operational success and duration, catch efficiency and composition of traditional deep water cast nets. The highest operation success rate was obtained from 60 to 120 meter depth with 84.2%. The highest mean CPUE was established at 0.42 kg/operation in August. The catch rate of whiting, the main target species of the study, of the total catch was calculated as 98.8%. In this study, the effect of deep water cast nets on the ecosystem was also investigated. According to the findings, fishing season and operation depth significantly affect the catch per unit effort. In terms of ecosystem-based fisheries management due to high selectivity, the low impact of ghost fishing and high survival rate of the individuals, the deep water cast net fishing was found to be beneficial.

Our objective was to investigate chronic effects of otter trawl fishery on substratum and megabenthos on the shelf (50-400 m) and slope (400-2000 m) in the southern Barents Sea. The study area represents a wide range in the history of fishing intensity (FI). Physical impact of trawling, density of trawl marks (TMs), was quantified on 250 video transects from shelf and slope, and megabenthos (>2 cm) composition was studied on 149 video transects from the shelf. The number of satellite-recorded vessels within grid cells 5 × 5 km was used as a proxy for FI in the TM analysis and for the megabenthos records within a 2-km radius around the transects. The effects of using different search area sizes were tested. Patterns in the density of TMs and megabenthos composition were compared with FI using linear regression and correspondence analysis. Occurrence of TMs was not directly related to FI but to bottom type, whereas megabenthos density and diversity showed a negative relation. For 79 of the 97 most common taxa, density was negatively correlated with FI.

However, population performance is poorly known. Here, we combine official information and on-board observers’ data over two decades to study the fishery ecology of an aggregation occurring in a coastal upwelling system (Ría de Arousa, NW Spain). Annual landings fluctuated around a mean of 170 tons while beam trawlers declined at a rate of 11 vessels per decade. A hurdle Bayesian spatial model fitted to observers’ catch and effort data showed that the probability of occurrence and abundance of the species increased with fishing effort and decreased in sandy bottoms. Moreover, abundance increased with upwelling intensity and decreased with continental runoff and along the fishing season. Furthermore, occurrence was higher in the inner part of the embayment while abundance increased in the central channel. The predicted index of standardized abundance correlated with the trend in landings, and year-to-year fluctuations in abundance were negatively and positively related to upwelling intensity and net primary production, respectively, during the spawning and settlement period. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;Western Waters - non CS;10,000-50,000;multidecadal;10,000-50,000;multidecadal;Fisheries Dependent Data;NA;hurdle Bayesian spatial model;2;2;3;NA;NA;4.3;Fisheries dependent survey;Benthos;Benthic_epifauna;Other;NA;Aequipecten opercularis;Physical disturbance of the seabed;NA;Fishing effort;Other environmental drivers investigated, as daily upwelling conditions, daily;;;;;;;;;

In 2006, Norway’s first lobster reserves were implemented, with the aim of protecting European lobster (Homarus gammarus) through a ban on fixed gear. A before–after control-impact paired series (BACIPS) monitoring program was initiated to evaluate effects of protection on depleted lobster populations. Experimental trapping and capture-recapture techniques were combined to track demography of populations, also including movement of individuals within and beyond MPAs and adjacent control areas. Further, population genetics and parentage studies were applied, allowing for estimation of gene flow, and novel work on sexual selection in lobsters. Additional studies have evaluated MPA effects on coastal cod (Gadus morhua), and on commercially harvested labrids (Ctenolabrus rupestris and Symphodus melops) and anadromous brown trout (Salmo trutta). Together, these studies reported effects of protection pertaining to increased population density, survival, body size and phenotypic diversity, changes in emigration and interaction with surrounding fisheries, and alteration of selection pressure on morphological- and behavioral traits. Designation of MPAs in close collaboration with fishers and managers, long-term monitoring, inclusion of citizen science and evolving research protocols—also including fisheries data—have revealed novel effects of protection and harvesting on marine populations, thus providing substantial contributions to conservation science. Moreover, knowledge of MPA effects on coastal species has impacted harvest regulations showing the utility of MPAs as empirically documented management tools in Norway. © Copyright © 2021 Moland, Fernández-Chacón, Sørdalen, Villegas-Ríos, Thorbjørnsen, Halvorsen, Huserbråten, Olsen, Nillos Kleiven, Kleiven, Knutsen, Espeland, Freitas and Knutsen.;English;Review;All Open Access, Gold, Green;Scopus;EXCLUDE on study type;North Sea - non CS;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;None;NA;Benthos;Benthic_epifauna;Other;NA;Homarus gammarus + additionally: Gadus morhua, labrids (Ctenolabrus rupestris and Symphodus melops) and anadromous brown trout (Salmo trutta);NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Together, these studies reported effects of protection pertaining to increased population density, survival, body size and phenotypic diversity, changes in emigration and interaction with surrounding fisheries, and alteration of selection pressure on morphological and behavioral traits.;VanHoey

The present study used various indicators to analyze and compare the differences between the demersal fish assemblages in a fishing closure area (FCA) established by the fishers of the Roses port (NW Mediterranean) and those on a fishing ground (FG) to assess the efficiency of this strategy two years after the cessation of fishing. Our findings demonstrated a noticeable increase in the abundance and biomass of all species in the FCA, especially species of small and medium size. Thus, our findings demonstrated that there were detectable shifts in the community (composition, rank abundance plots, ABC curves and diversity metrics) in a short time, evidencing slight disturbance effects on ecosystems. The present study also showed positive effects on the population structure, which had an increase in larger individuals, although the pattern varied between species. In particular, the European hake stock showed an increase in recruits, and the presence of large adults supported the suitability of this protection measure.

This competitive overlap between fishing and cetaceans often results in inadequate solutions so that in some cases there have been cases of intentional cetacean culling to maximize fishing production. A modelling approach applied to investigate the ecological roles of cetaceans in the food web could prove more effective to integrate ecological and fishing aspects and to provide suggestions for management. The comparative analysis carried out in the Gulf of Taranto (Northern Ionian Sea, Central Mediterranean Sea) showed that fishing exploitation provides impacts on the investigated food web greater than those due to cetacean predation. Trawling was estimated to be the most negatively impacting fishing gear considering the mortality rates and consumption flows. On the other hand, the striped dolphin was the main impact on the food web due to its highest consumption flows. Analysis showed a negative and non-selective impact on the exploited species due to the fishing gears, while the odontocetes proved to select their prey species and provide a positive impact in the assemblage. In particular, while the fishing gears are primarily size selective, targeting mostly large and economically valuable fish, the odontocetes seem to follow a co-evolution process with their prey, developing a specialization in their resources, providing control of the meso-consumers and ensuring a trophic stability in the ecosystem. © 2020, The Author(s).;English;Article;All Open Access, Hybrid Gold;Scopus;NA;Mediterranean - non CS;>100,000;NA;>100,000;NA;Simulated dynamics;NA;Ecopath;2;2;3;NA;NA;4.4;Modelling/simulation;Marine_mammals;Cetaceans;NA;NA;NA;Catch_and_bycatch;NA;Fishing effort;NA;Commercial;NA;NA;The small-scale fishery (gillnets, trammel nets, set long lines, traps) is characterized by vessels with a length-over-all (LOA) of 6–12 m limiting operation to the coastal grounds, while the bottom otter trawls (LOA of 12–18 m) mainly exploit the shelf break and slope (Russo et al. 2017);Food web indices;Trophic structure;Negative;The comparative analysis on the impacts of odontocetes species and fishery on the food web showed that those due to fishing exploitation are greater than those due to cetacean predation.

Fisheries modify the structure and functioning of food-webs through biomass removal and physical damage to the seabed, leading to loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services provided by the oceans. The ecosystem-based approach to fisheries is considered the most efficient way to achieve the goal of sustainable use of marine resources while allowing for biodiversity protection. The Strait of Sicily is a biologically important area of the central Mediterranean Sea characterized by high habitat complexity and rich biodiversity, however, due to the multispecific nature of local fisheries and weak implementation of the adopted management plans, this region is particularly vulnerable. We used fishery independent time series (1994–2016) to identify the main demersal assemblages and map their spatial distribution. The pressure of fishing effort on each of these defined assemblages was then quantified in order to evaluate the impact of bottom trawling on demersal communities. Our results showed four spatially distinct and temporally stable assemblages of the Strait of Sicily. These have a clear spatial distribution, different species composition and biodiversity values and are driven primarily by environmental gradients (i.e., mainly depth and, to a lesser extent, surface salinity). The demersal assemblages were subsequently grouped in homogeneous areas characterized by specific communities of commercial and non-commercial species and response to trawling impacts. These areas are proposed as Spatial Managements Units to evaluate and manage demersal mixed fisheries, while also considering biodiversity conservation in the central Mediterranean Sea. © Copyright © 2020 Lauria, Gristina, Fiorentino, Attrill and Garofalo.;English;Article;All Open Access, Gold, Green;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;CS - Mediterranean;>100,000;decade;>100,000;decade;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Impact of fishery as factor mentioned, fishery data (VMS) used, but does not appear as structuring factor for the fish assemblages.

This study focuses more on functional characteristics by addressing the biogeochemical consequences associated with tickler chain beam trawl and electric PulseWing trawl gears. In June 2017, professional fishermen trawled experimental transects with both types of gears in the Frisian Front area of the North Sea. Box core sediment samples and in situ landers were used to evaluate biogeochemical fluxes and sediment characteristics in untrawled and trawled areas (samples taken 3.5-70 h after fishing). A reduction of sedimentary chlorophyll a was observed, which was larger following tickler chain (83%) compared to PulseWing trawling (43%). This displacement of surface material caused significant decreases in the sediment oxygen consumption in tickler chain (41%) and PulseWing trawled samples (33%) along with a deeper penetration of oxygen in the sediment (tickler chain: 3.78 mm, PulseWing: 3.17 mm) compared to untrawled areas (2.27 mm). Our research implies that bottom trawl disturbance can lead to immediate declines in benthic community metabolism, with tickler chain trawling exhibiting more prominent alterations than PulseWing trawling on benthic biogeochemical processes. © 2019 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2019.

Among them, seabirds are the most conspicuous and have been benefiting from anthropogenic food sources generated by fisheries. However, this modified feeding behaviour also exposes them to threats, such as accidental bycatch on fishing gear and ecological traps set by discards of lower nutritional value compared to seabird natural prey. Seabird-fishery interactions have been the focus of numerous studies, but very few integrative investigations tested multi-annual dynamics. To explore this temporal dimension, we performed stable isotopic and body condition analyses, as well as GPS-tracking in Northern gannets (Morus bassanus) over a 12-year period (2005–2017), during which they coexisted with fisheries in the English Channel. We demonstrate that gannets fed either on natural prey, or fishery wastes, but that discard consumption induced increased seabird foraging effort and reduced adult body condition. These changes are concomitant with reduced gannet reproductive success, and reduced growth rate of their breeding population. Our work provides essential, novel understanding of scavengers-fisheries interactions, by showing that fishery discards do not compensate natural prey shortage in the longer term. Altered gannet foraging and fitness strongly suggest pelagic fish depletion threatening Northern gannets in the English Channel. To improve gannet conservation in this ecoregion, fishery discards may be banned, but, efforts should in priority go towards rebuilding Northern gannet pelagic prey populations, particularly by strongly reducing fishing effort on North Atlantic mackerel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd;English;Article;All Open Access, Bronze, Green;Scopus;NA;CS - North Sea;>100,000;five year;>100,000;year;Data Storage, GPS, Acoustic Taggin;GPS tagging;NA;2;2;3;NA;NA;None;Fisheries independent survey;Seabirds;NA;NA;NA;Morus bassanus;Discarding;NA;Discarded fraction;NA;Commercial;NA;NA;NA;Stable isotope for diet _ body mass _ breeding success _ population ;Physiology;Negative;We demonstrate that gannets fed either on natural prey, or fishery wastes, but that discard consumption induced increased seabird foraging effort and reduced adult body condition.

Over 50,000 capture events and likely over 10,000 deaths are estimated to occur in the Italian waters alone. However, current knowledge on the interaction of sea turtles with fishing gears and the implementation of mitigation measures are still poor to hinder the decline of turtle populations in the Mediterranean. In this basin, where fisheries are multispecies, multi-gears and multinational, making demersal fishing activities profitable while preserving sea turtles is a challenge. This study aimed to develop bycatch reducer devices (BRDs) and alternative fishing gears to mitigate the impact of demersal fishing gears on sea turtles: (a) hard and flexible turtle excluder devices (TEDs) were tested in bottom trawling to immediately exclude turtles from the net;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Moreover, the fisheries yield is quantified and analyzed in terms of landings with respect to official management area of registration of vessels. In this way, the real area of activity of each fleet is not considered and this prevent an effective spatial analysis of the factors affecting fisheries yield and stocks status. This paper firstly presents a VMS-based reconstruction of the fishing effort and of the area of activity of the Italian trawlers in the Mediterranean Sea. The fishing area of each fleet is then used as a spatial reference to estimate primary productivity rate and gross primary production and to investigate, by using General Additive Models, the effects of trawling effort, primary production and time on fisheries yield, fisheries productivity and overexploitation rate for some key demersal species. The results evidence that the usage of satellite-based information of fishing activities and of primary production, when combined at the real spatial scale of fishing activities, could effectively improve our ability to analyze the response of the ecosystems to these driving forces and allow capturing the main trends of yield, productivity and overexploitation rate of demersal stocks. © 2019 Russo, Carpentieri, D'Andrea, De Angelis, Fiorentino, Franceschini, Garofalo, Labanchi, Parisi, Scardi and Cataudella.;English;Article;All Open Access, Gold, Green;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;CS - Mediterranean;>100,000;NA;>100,000;NA;Fisheries Dependent Data;NA;VMS_AIS_fishery catch;NA;NA;NA;NA;No real impact of fishery, only determination of linkage between fishery activity, primary prodution and fish production (based on catches);None;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;VanHoey

Discard survival is known to be highly variable and influenced by numerous factors, including conditions during the catch, on-board the fishing vessels, and post-discard. Therefore, obtaining unambiguous results in discard survival experiments is challenging. We conducted the first systematic year-round discard survival study of flatfish in the Western Baltic Sea on-board a commercial stern trawler under realistic fishing conditions (13 monthly hauls from May 2015 to May 2016) to test whether delayed mortality can be predicted by vitality scores and reflex action mortality predictor (RAMP) scores in combination with variable conditions during catch, processing, and post-release. The factors vessel type, gear, haul duration, fishing ground, depth, handling time, and processing procedures were kept constant as much as possible. On-board, live individual flatfish were tested for vitality and the presence of reflexes for RAMP, then “discarded” and kept in cages on the bottom of the seafloor for about a week after which the delayed mortality was determined. The proportions of “discarded” plaice, flounder, and dab that were dead after being kept in the cages ranged from 5% to 100%, 0% to 96%, and 33% to 100%, respectively. Higher mortalities occurred in summer-autumn when air and water temperatures were higher, catches smaller, and catches contained smaller proportions of roundfish. Relationships between RAMP scores and mortality probabilities varied substantially across the monthly trials. Indeed, in addition to RAMP or vitality scores and individual reflexes, the factors air and water temperature and catch weight and catch composition were significant in logistic GLMs explaining delayed mortality. Cross-validations indicated that delayed mortality could be predicted by these models with a reasonable accuracy. Nevertheless, the presence of possible confounding effects calls for caution in inferring causality and extrapolating the conclusions on predictability. © International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2018.

A large proportion of the purse seiners of the Adriatic fleet that target small pelagic species may be using gear that does not comply with regulatory provisions. This study provides a thorough overview on Adriatic purse seine designs and fishing practices. Moreover, since no detailed information was available about their environmental impact, an ad hoc study was also performed to examine the issue in relation to Mediterranean Regulation provisions. Analysis of the technical data confirmed the vast majority of the nets used by the Adriatic purse seine fleet do not comply with regulatory provisions. However, data analysis highlighted that the technical features and operational characteristics of these fisheries do not justify the application of MR restrictions. In fact, i) spatial analysis of the fishing effort demonstrated that purse seiners operate more than 3 nautical miles off the coast, i.e. further than the area covered by the restrictions;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Prey availability may in turn be affected by bottom trawling. Our study attempted to link the prey consumed by fish directly to those available in the benthic environment. We test the hypothesis that bottom trawling significantly affected the trait composition of fish diets with a strong link to benthic habitats. Stomach content data were analysed for seven demersal and benthivorous fish species in the southern and central North Sea and were related to habitat fauna collected by grab and epi-benthic trawl data across the same spatial extent. Biological trait analysis was used to avoid taxonomic bias in large-scale comparisons across habitats and to quantify the effect of bottom trawling, which tends to shift prey diversity in favour of small, opportunistic and short-lived species and traits. The diets of two demersal omnivores (whiting, Merlangius merlangus and Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua) and two opportunistic benthivores (haddock, Melanogrammus aeglefinus and long-rough dab, Hippoglossoides platessoides) did not appear to reflect either infaunal or epifaunal traits that were abundant in the benthic environment. The diets of European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and Dover sole (Solea solea), however, showed strong links with infaunal prey trait composition in shallow sand to muddy sand habitats located in the eastern North Sea and the Dogger Bank. Such strong links were also observed for the diets of Common dab (Limanda limanda) and plaice in similar habitats in deeper waters. Plaice targeted small to medium sized infaunal burrowers and deeper dwelling infaunal species. Its diet was significantly affected by bottom trawling, which caused a reduction in prey biomass in their stomachs rather than a shift in trait composition. Our study showed that the diets of benthivorous fish across large spatial scales are strongly linked with the prey trait availability in their benthic habitats and that bottom trawling significantly affected the diet of plaice, a species with strong habitat-diet associations. © 2018;English;Article;;Scopus;NA;CS - North Sea;>100,000;multidecadal;>100,000;year;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;distance-based linear models (DISTLM);2;2;3;NA;NA;4.4;Fisheries independent survey;Fish_teleost;Flatfish;NA;NA;Pleuronectes platessa;Physical disturbance of the seabed;NA;Fishing effort;NA;Commercial;NA;NA;The trawling intensity is based on the combined intensity of otter trawling, demersal seining, beam trawling and dredging (Eigaard et al., 2017);Trait composition diet;Trophic structure;Negative;Bottom trawling had significant statistical effects (P < .05) on the trait diet composition of plaice in habitat cluster 1 for all univariate measures of diet diversity except the total number of trait modalities.

Without regulation, this activity can lead to the decrease of lugworms’ population meanwhile affecting the physical characteristics of the beach and the biodiversity. Here, we identified through morphology and genetics two species of lugworms, Arenicola marina and A. defodiens, within a Marine Protected Area of the Eastern English Channel (France). For each species, abundance and spatial distribution were assessed using a stratified random sampling and interpolation at four studied sites, as well as some life-history traits. These data were compared to lugworms’ collection data to estimate its sustainability and to provide potential management measures. At one site, A. marina was present in large numbers on the higher and middle shore, whereas A. defodiens occupied the lower shore. At the other sites, both species co-occurred on the lower shore, and A. marina individuals were less numerous and lacking recruits. Spawning periods for A. marina occurred in early autumn and in late autumn for A. defodiens. The size at first maturity of A. marina was at 3.8 cm of trunk length (between 1.5 and 2.5 years old). One site (Au) appeared in need for management when linking abundance data with bait collection, where harvest of both species represented ~14% of the total amount of lugworms and was above the carrying capacity of the beach for A. marina. The retail value associated to lugworm harvesting within the MPA was estimated at the same level as the shrimp retail value.

This study attempts to complement existing data sets and construct the profile of recreational fisheries in the EU-Mediterranean countries using videos publicly available on social media. A total of 1526 video records were selected, featuring the capture of 7799 fish specimens. The results show recreational fishing is multispecies in nature (26 species contributed to >80% % of the most numerically important species caught) and exhibits a spatially homogeneous pattern, with differences in species composition being mostly dependent on the fishing technique used rather than on the country. Such findings fill an important knowledge gap on recreational fishing activities, and the methodology provides an innovative approach to gather statistics on data-poor thematic areas that can potentially complement other data sets, such as the EU Data Collection Multi-Annual Programme. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd;English;Article;;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;CS - Mediterranean;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;Social media videos to harvest catch data;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4.2;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;VanHoey

This article examines long-term changes in the distribution and occurrence of the elasmobranch assemblage of the southern North Sea, based on extensive historical time series (1902-2013) of fishery-independent survey data. In general, larger species (thornback ray, tope, spurdog) exhibited long-term declines, and the largest (common skate complex) became locally extirpated (as did angelshark). Smaller species increased (spotted and starry ray, lesser-spotted dogfish) as did smooth-hound, likely benefiting from greater resilience to fishing and/or climate change. This indicates a fundamental shift from historical dominance of larger, commercially valuable species to current prevalence of smaller, more productive species often of low commercial value. In recent years, however, some trends have reversed, with the (cold-water associated) starry ray now declining and thornback ray increasing. This shift may be attributed to (i) fishing, including mechanised beam trawling introduced in the 1960s-1970s, and historical target fisheries for elasmobranchs;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

An extended bio-economic model of a fishery is developed to include nutrient enrichment and built into a general model of the polluting and fishery sector with nutrient concentration and fish stock as state variables. The marginal damage function for nutrient enrichment is derived. This function can be compared with the marginal abatement cost and hence it provides a basis for policies that balance the use of nutrients in land-based industries (for example agriculture) with the external cost to the marine environment. The model is empirically applied to the case of the Baltic Sea, where Eastern Baltic cod fisheries are affected by nutrient enrichment. The results indicate that nitrogen loading needs to be reduced slightly (around 1 %) to reach optimal levels. The results also show that the optimal fishery policy plays a more important role in producing the net benefits than nitrogen reduction policies do.

Current values of the LFI are ~0.15, but the European Union (EU) Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) requires a value of 0.3 be reached by 2020. An LFI calculated from an eight-species subset correlated closely with the full community LFI, thereby permitting an exploration of the effects of various fishing scenarios on projected values of the LFI using an extension of a previously published multi-species length-structured model that included these key species. The model replicated historical changes in biomass and size composition of individual species, and generated an LFI that was significantly correlated with observations. A community-wide reduction in fishing mortality of ~60% from 2008 values was necessary to meet the LFI target, driven mainly by changes in cod and saithe. A 70% reduction in cod fishing mortality alone, or a 75% reduction in otter trawl effort, was also sufficient to achieve the target. Reductions in fishing mortality necessary to achieve maximum sustainable harvesting rates are projected to result in the LFI over-shooting its target. © 2015 The Authors.;English;Article;All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green;Scopus;NA;CS - North Sea;>100,000;multidecadal;>100,000;multidecadal;Simulated dynamics;The North Sea First Quarter (Q1) International Bottom TrawlSurvey (IBTS);We used the Speirs et al.

The same canyon area has been revisited a decade later, and new data are consistent with a sedimentary regime shift during the 1970s and also suggest that the accumulation rate during the last decade could be greater than expected, approaching ~2.4 cm yr-1 (compared to ~0.25 cm yr-1 pre-1970s). These results support the hypothesis that commercial bottom trawling can substantially affect sediment dynamics and budgets on continental margins, eventually initiating the formation of anthropogenic depocenters in submarine canyon environments.

Interviews covered 41.3% of the bottom trawling fleet in the region and included 111 fishermen (one per boat). Results were combined with those from previous studies conducted in neighbouring regions using the same methodology to assess the global impact of bottom trawling on the western Mediterranean stock of the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta). Estimated turtle catch per unit effort (CPUE) is 0.09 turtles per vessel per month, according to the information reported by fishermen. As a consequence, the whole fleet of bottom trawlers operating off the Valencia region was involved annually in 238 turtle bycatch events (95%, CI: 173-304). Ivlev's electivity index revealed that bottom trawling bycatch was higher than expected according to fishing effort in the northern part of the study area, where the continental shelf widens. The fishermen's perception was that the local stock of loggerhead turtles is declining, and that drifting longlines and bottom trawling are, at least in part, responsible for this trend. According to previous studies as well as the current results, bottom trawlers operating off mainland Spain capture mainly loggerhead turtles from the rookeries in the eastern Mediterranean, with only a low percentage of turtles of Atlantic origin. Loggerhead turtle bycatch by bottom trawling deserves more attention in the Valencia region, particularly in its northern part.

Here, we investigated the influence of partial protection - excluding fixed gears such as gillnets and traps but still allowing a hook and line fishery - on the demography of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua along the Norwegian Skagerrak coast. To do so, we applied novel multi-event models to a 9-year data set containing both live recaptures and dead recoveries of marked fish of different sizes collected before and after the implementation of an MPA, also including several unprotected sites. At the MPA site, the annual proportion of deaths due to fishing decreased from 0·59 before MPA implementation to 0·32 after MPA implementation. As a result, annual survival increased by 167% (from 0·09 to 0·24) for small (16-44 cm) and 83% (from 0·23 to 0·42) for big (45-97 cm) cod, respectively. Average survival was lower in unprotected areas, and annual fishing mortality was higher, representing almost 100% of the total mortality of large-sized cod in some years. Annual emigration rates (i.e. spillover from the MPA) increased in the last years of the study, but no differences in body growth were detected between sites. Closure of the fishery within the MPA would further increase the annual survival of smaller individuals by 100% (from 0·24 ± 0·07 to 0·48 ± 0·11) and that of larger individuals by 44% (from 0·42 ± 0·05 to 0·60 ± 0·09). Synthesis and applications. Our study reveals how current marine protected areas (MPAs) function and provides important insights for guiding a future adaptive management process.

Differences and particularities in dolphin seasonal occurrence and habitat use in each MPA are discussed. While bottlenose dolphins were detected year round and at all hours of the day in most of these MPAs, there was a clear preference for the winter period and the night time. At least two of these MPAs provided a more suitable foraging habitat than their surrounding environments. This monitoring method was precise enough to describe the sensitivity of bottlenose dolphins to human activities in and around MPAs. Anthropogenic activities considered in this study included fish farming, presence of commercial trawling, artisanal set nets, and recreational activities (i.e. SCUBA diving and anchoring vessels). MPAs with fish farms or nearby fish trawling activity yielded highest levels of dolphin presence due to an increase in the concentration of prey resources. Diel patterns in dolphin presence were presumably affected by set netting, where dolphins predated on net catches but avoided encounters with fishermen. An inverse relationship between dolphin presence and average intensity of recreational activities was found. A preference for months and times of day of low intensity of recreational activity suggests that human presence in these MPAs might displace bottlenose dolphins. The cost-effective monitoring method presented in this study could help developing required monitoring programs in Spanish Mediterranean protected waters under the European Union Habitats Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.;English;Article;;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;Mediterranean - non CS;>100,000;year;>100,000;month;Active Acoustic Sampling Survey;NA;NA;2;2;3;NA;NA;None;Other;Marine_mammals;Cetaceans;Toothed_cetacean;NA;Tursiops truncatus;Visual disturbance;NA;NA;scuba diving and anchoring (with negative effects);NA;NA;NA;NA;occurrence;Abundance/biomass/density;Positive;Commercial trawling presencewas considered in the interpretation of the results;VanHoey

These seals were not bycaught by entering the pot through the entrance, thereby not included in the analysis. All the other 24 seals included in the analysis were caught only in control pots.;VanHoey

Analyses of excess 210Pb concentrations and grain size fractions in sediment cores from their canyon axes revealed that sedimentation rates and silt contents increased in all canyons in the 1980s, due to the expansion of more powerful trawlers (&gt;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, we investigated the composition of marine debris in the Iskenderun Bay seafloor. Between November 2009 and April 2010, a total of 34 trawl operations were conducted. Hauls lasted 60–385 min, and the towing speed varied between 2.7 and 2.8 knots. The estimated average marine litter concentration was 450.94 item/km2 (90.34 kg/km2). Plastic was the dominant material type (87%) at all stations. Single-use plastic items represented about 74.9% of the total marine litter. Our results showed that there is severe plastic pollution on the seafloor of Iskenderun Bay that may cause significant damage to both the fisheries sector and the marine environment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd;English;Article;NA;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4.5;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;vdReijden

Sensitivity to fishing increases along a “fast-to-slow” gradient of life history strategies, and the “slow” species (large, long-lived, late-maturing, giving birth to few large offspring) require the most time to recover from fishing. In the North East Atlantic, after having reached extreme levels, fishing pressure has decreased since the 1980's due to management measures such as total allowable catch (TAC) or area closure. An effect on the distribution of species as well as a potential recovery could be expected. However, temporal patterns of life history strategies are rarely linked to management measures. In addition, a larger emphasis is often put on exploited or emblematic sensitive species but rarely on assembly processes at the ecosystem scale (both commercial and non-commercial species). Based on a 17-year time series of 101 taxa (fishes, elasmobranchs, bivalves, cephalopods and crustaceans), we observed a negative relationship between the biomass of taxa sensitive to fishing and bottom trawling pressure, as well as an increase in their total biomass in the Celtic Sea. Over the whole area, stochasticity appeared as the dominant assembly process. Deterministic assembly processes were at play in the centre of the area where significant overdispersion (caused by the presence of both slow and fast taxa) were observed. The absence of sensitive taxa from the rest of the Celtic Sea appeared to be caused mainly by a historical effect of environmental filtering when fishing was high. At the local scale, we related the decrease in fishing pressure to the increase in biomass of five of the most sensitive taxa.

For the time period between 2011 and 2015, commercial fisheries were responsible for the largest total fish biomass extraction (5,300 t per year), followed by cormorants (2,394 t per year) and recreational fishers (966 t per year). Commercial fishing dominated the removals of most marine and diadromous fish, specifically herring (Clupea harengus), while cormorants dominated the biomass extraction of smaller-bodied coastal freshwater fish, specifically perch (Perca fluviatilis) and roach (Rutilus rutilus). Pike (Esox lucius) as large-bodied freshwater fish was the only species where recreational fisheries were responsible for the major fraction of the annual biomass extraction. A strong trophic overlap and hence a similar foraging niche was documented among commercial fishers and recreational anglers and among non-resident and resident anglers, indicating that the aversion expressed by anglers against commercial fisheries in a survey had an objective underpinning related to resource competition. By contrast, the foraging niches of cormorants and of both fishers and anglers differed strongly as evidenced by largely non-overlapping sets of species that were caught and removed by cormorants and by commercial as well as recreational fishers. However, for individual species of commercial and recreational interest, specifically perch, cormorants were responsible for a major fraction of total biomass extraction, suggesting that at the individual fish species level competition with fishers and anglers may still occur. In an angler survey, respondents expressed a preference for cormorant control, indicating the existence of conflict between fisheries and cormorants. We recommend that conflicts in the lagoon fisheries be proactively managed, e.g., through improved communication, zoning, predator control and outreach.

Chondrichthyes are key top-predators and their removal from marine ecosystems due to fishing exploitation could lead to changes in species interactions and biomass that can negatively influence the provision of ecosystems services. The ecological role of the demersal Chondrichthyes living in the marine food web of the Calabrian area in the Northern Ionian Sea (Central Mediterranean Sea) was analysed by means of ecological indicators derived from Ecopath mass-balance food web models estimated in their stationary states during the periods 1995–1997, 2003–2005 and 2013–2015. The trophic web model was described by 57 functional groups (7 of which representing the demersal Chondrichthyes), which were described by their Biomass (t/km2), Production and Consumption rate, Diet, Landings (t/km2) e Discards (t/km2). Remarkable changes in biomass were recorded for shark and rays, as a consequence of changes in fishing patterns and oceanographic regime shift named Bimodal Oscillating Systems (BiOS). Demersal Chondrichthyes occupy high trophic positions in the Calabria food web showing trophic levels higher than 4.1, with the D. licha identified as the main apex predators, while E. spinax and G. melastomus as meso-predators. The pattern of the consumption flows highlighted a potential sensitivity of E. spinax and G. melastomus to the changes in deep waters circulation caused by the BiOS acting on the entire ecosystem of the Ionian Sea. D. licha was identified as the main keystone predators in all the investigated periods. The analysis of the trophic indirect and direct impacts shows the role of the demersal Chondrichthyes as beneficial predators, with positive effects on several preys. Results also showed that G. melastomus and the Shelf Elasmobranchs group (e.g. Raja asterias, Mustelus mustelus, etc.…) were overexploited in 1995 and that all groups of sharks and rays underwent to a decrease of exploitation rate over time. Chondrichthyes showed medium-low values of overlap with the fishing gears (&lt;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Here, we modeled the biomass distribution of eight commercial marine species in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea during winter and summer. We hypothesised that the seasonal differences of the water column and the spatial heterogeneity of oceanographic conditions in the study area could result in seasonal variations on the species biomass distributions. We employed a Bayesian hierarchical species distribution modelling approach (B-SDM) with data from two experimental trawl surveys to analyse which are the significant drivers in each season. Our results showed that bathymetry, temperature and fishing patterns are important variables explaining the species spatial biomass distributions.

Damage was assessed by quantifying shell and foot damage on commercial clams caught with mechanical dredges. Survival experiments were carried out to assess their survival capacity after 24 h purification treatment and 72 h cold storage, which represents an issue of great interest for fisheries research, management and marketing. Overall, 2.4% of wedge clams suffered any type of damage, including chipped edges and scratched valves. Higher proportions of shell-damaged individuals were positively correlated to bottom features (e.g. gravel content in sediment). Moreover, higher towing speed significantly increased shell damage. Analyses of shell damage areas revealed that the anterior dorsal and ventral parts of the shell are the most vulnerable to dredging. A total of 15.9% of individuals showed damage on the foot, which seems not to affect their survival. The incidence of foot damage was mostly linked to sublethal predation, reflected in a positive correlation between the proportion of foot-damaged individuals and biomass of decapod crustaceans in the fishing ground. Finally, D. trunculus exhibited very low mortality rates after 24 h purification treatment (0.2–0.4%) and 72 h cold storage (0.3–3.2%). The survival rate at the end of the experiment was high (>96%), with the highest mortality observed 96 h after the fishing day. No correlations were found between mortality rates and bottom type or towing speed. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;English;Article;NA;Scopus;NA;Mediterranean - non CS;50,000-100,000;two month;10,000-50,000;snapshot/no repeat sampling;Fisheries Dependent Data;NA;Summarizing statistics;1;1;3;The wedge clam seems to have a resistant shell to dredging operations, being unlikely to crack and break easily during towing, as it is reflected by the low proportion (2.4%) of shell-damaged individuals collected in this study.;NA;4.3;Fisheries dependent survey;Benthos;Benthic_infauna;NA;sand;Donax trunculus;Catch_and_bycatch;Target;Fishing activity;Sediment type;Commercial;Dredges;Mechanic dredge;NA;Clam survival;Survival;Negative;The proportion of wedgeclams that survived after 24 h purification treatment was >99% (Figure 7), without significant spatial differences between Fuengirola and Caleta (K-W: P > 0.05).;vdReijden

To select suitable methods for local circumstances, evaluating approaches used in other jurisdictions can be a cost-effective first step. We tested Productivity Susceptibility Analysis (PSA) to assess the potential vulnerability of the marine fish community in the Skagerrak-Kattegat (Eastern North Sea) to possible interactions with all Swedish fisheries operating in the area. This analysis combines attributes for a species productivity with attributes related to the susceptibility to capture to quantify a single score for vulnerability: high, medium, or low risk. Results indicate that demersal trawl and gillnet fisheries were associated with the highest risk levels if interaction occurs, i.e. having the highest prevalence of species with potentially high vulnerability to the fisheries. Mixed results were seen when comparing the assessment results with available data. The main benefit of utilizing PSA in the area is the comprehensiveness of the assessment, including data-deficient fisheries and species. Drawbacks include potential overestimation of actual risks. Overall, together with available data, PSA in the studied area provides a comprehensive map of potential risks for further actions and may progress a science-based, precautionary management of the area. © 2020 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2020.

This change has been recommended in the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean and European Commission regulations. However, ecosystem-based assessment of improved selectivity still remains a challenge, and that is the aim of this study. For this purpose, an Ecopath model was developed and used to initialize dynamic simulations in Ecosim. The simulations changed gear-specific fishing mortality rates to represent the shifting from traditional codend to alternative codends. Our results suggest that the use of D50 or S40 codends would have a positive impact on the ecosystem as a whole and on the stock status of several commercial and non-commercial groups. Mixed trophic impact analysis indicated that, for species, like red mullet, the S40 codend was significantly better than the D50 codend. This information can be useful to policymakers, particularly for the areas where red mullet is the main target species and could inform trawl mesh options in the eastern Mediterranean. © 2020 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2020.

Low densities of urban litter were registered on the shelf (7.2 items ha-1), increasing in abundance towards the deepest part of the submarine canyon, with 188 items ha-1 below 1000 m depth. We hypothesize that the strong bottom currents that recurrently affect this area efficiently move litter objects from the shelf towards the deep. Of all litter items, approximately 50% had a fishing-related origin, mostly longlines entangled on rocks in the canyon head and discarded trawl nets in deeper areas. Over 10% of cold-water colonies observed had longlines entangled, indicating the harmful effects of such practices over benthic habitats.

Spanish Fisheries as a Case Study;2020;Frontiers in Marine Science;7;NA;NA;NA;10.3389/fmars.2020.00459;NA;The Multiannual Management Plan embedded in Regulation EU 2019/1022 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 20, 2019, envisages to reform Mediterranean demersal fisheries to restore stocks to maximum sustainability yields by 2025. This paper leverages a bioeconomic model based on a specific case study of the Western Mediterranean Sea to analyze the objectives of this new EU reform. We complement this analysis with simulations based on alternative management strategies: the reduction of fishing effort of 1–2 days-per-week and changes to selectivity patterns. Effects on artisanal fleets are also analyzed in order to assess scenarios that could achieve sustainability for all demersal fishing fleets. The results reveal that it is not possible to achieve the plan’s aims for all stocks. Furthermore, the fishing time established is insufficient, although it would increase economic, and biological indicators for medium- and long-term periods. The best scenarios would be achieved by applying selective changes that provide for faster recovery of biological and economic indicators for trawler and artisanal fleets. The results also reveal that the reduction in the number of fishing days per week complemented with selectivity changes would have a lower socioeconomic impact than a reduction in fishing effort based entirely on fishing days or number of boats.

This involves identifying where populations persist, where populations may still be present, and where populations may be locally extinct. Three threatened angel sharks occur in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea: Sawback Angelshark (Squatina aculeata), Smoothback Angelshark (Squatina oculata), and Angelshark (Squatina squatina). Population sizes and geographic ranges of these species have been reduced due to overfishing and habitat loss, placing them among the world s most threatened chondrichthyans. We revise distribution maps, review global status, and present a Conservation Strategy to protect and restore these angel shark populations by minimizing fishing mortality, protecting critical habitat, and mitigating human disturbance. Updated distributions reveal that a halving of the geographic extent may have occurred for all three species, with potential declines of 51% for Sawback Angelshark, 48% for Smoothback Angelshark, and 58% for Angelshark. While 20 national and international management measures are now in place for Angelshark, only half of these include the other two species. We encourage further conservation action to adopt and develop this Conservation Strategy to restore angel shark populations to robust levels and safeguard them throughout their range. © 2019 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2019.

The introduction of large-scale driftnets caused unwanted catches of protected species. Specific regulations were therefore issued in European waters, culminating in a proposed moratorium on SSDs. This study aimed to characterise the SSD fishery targeting anchovy (menaide), evaluating its environmental sustainability, economic performance and social relevance. In 2013, a survey by interviews, logbooks and observers on board assessed the order of magnitude of this fishery in terms of fishing capacity and activity, volume of landings and revenues. The menaide fleet consisted in 60 vessels <12 m overall length, moored in little harbours in southern Italy. These nets are highly selective: the target species, European anchovy, Engraulis encrasicholus (L.) and sardine, Sardina pilchardus (Walbaum), dominates the catches, while discards are negligible.

In this study, we reconstruct ecological baselines defining benthic ecosystem composition prior to major anthropogenic changes at four stations characterized by low sedimentation and millennial-scale time averaging of molluscan assemblages. We discriminate between natural and anthropogenic drivers based on (1) stratigraphic changes in the composition of molluscan communities observed in sediment cores and (2) changes in concentrations of heavy metals, pollutants, and organic enrichment. The four 1.5-m long sediment cores reach back to the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary, allowing for a stratigraphic distinction of the major sea-level phases of the Holocene. During the transgressive phase and maximum flooding, sea-level and establishment of the modern circulation pattern determined the development of benthic communities in shallow-water, vegetated habitats with epifaunal biostromes and, in deeper waters, with bryozoan meadows. After sea-level stabilization, the composition of these baseline communities remained relatively uniform and started to change markedly only with the intensification of human impacts in the late highstand, leading to a dominance of infauna and a decline of epifauna at all sites. This profound ecological change reduced species richness, increased the abundance of infaunal suspension feeders, and led to a decline of grazers and deposit feeders. We suggest that modern soft-bottom benthic communities in the northern Adriatic Sea today do not show the high geographic heterogeneity in composition characteristic of benthos prior to anthropogenic influences.

This study assesses the spatial and seasonal impact of the northern central Adriatic midwater pair trawl fishery on loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) by examining incidental catches recorded between 2006 and 2018 and environmental variables. The model predicted seasonal variation of loggerhead distribution. According to previous studies, data analysis indicates that most bycatch events of loggerhead turtle occurred in the northern Adriatic Sea. The present data confirm that the northern Adriatic may be an important foraging area for loggerhead turtle.

A great number of the unregulated invertebrate species form the basis of essential fish habitats for important fisheries resources such as hake, red mullet and cuttlefish. Thus, data on their survival after discarding may help to interpret the role of these species within the benthic ecosystems. Furthermore, descriptor 6 of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (EU Directive 2008/56/E) foresees maintaining sea floor integrity at a level that ensures that the structure and functions of the ecosystems are safeguarded, and Article 7(d) of the Common Fisheries Policy (EU Reg. 1380/2013) foresees the implementation of management measures for fishing with low impact on the marine ecosystem and fishery resources. Survival measurements by direct recovery of tagged discarded species are not effective in bottom trawl fisheries, for which alternative studies such as semi-quantitative measures obtained on board prior to discarding can be considered as appropriate for mortality estimation. The present work assessed the survival of unwanted species using a semi-quantitative assessment on the deck of trawlers and at the laboratory for a period of 96 hours in two Mediterranean areas (the Catalan coast and the Ligurian and Northern Tyrrhenian seas). A high number of discarded invertebrates showed a high percentage of survival (>70%) in both assessments. The results can be used to provide information that can help to achieve higher survival levels of discarded specimens and enhance the productivity of fishing grounds by increasing the health of benthic ecosystems. © 2018, CSIC Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas.

The present study is aimed at investigating the effects of environmental and anthropogenic drivers on the abundance and spatial distribution of A. foliacea and A. antennatus in the Ligurian and northern and central Tyrrhenian Seas (NW Mediterranean). To this end, the time series of MEDITS trawl survey data (1994–2015) were analyzed together with environmental variables, namely sea surface temperature, current speed, and fishing effort by means of GAM.

It is an object of fishing in all the Black Sea countries, its catch reaches 100 thousand tons. Therefore, the task to monitor the state of the sprat population and identify the risk factors under existing conditions of increasing fishing intensity and climate change is of great importance. The subject of the study is to assess the impact of fishing on the state of the Black Sea sprat population and estimate the prospects of further exploitation of its commercial stock. The article is based on the results of our research and the annual reports of the European Commission's Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF). The catch of sprat in both regions was carried out with mid-water trawls, in the shelf zone in the near-bottom layer of water. In all calculations, the standard length (SL) in cm was measured. Long-term (2003-2013) dynamics of integrated characteristics of the size-age structure of sprat population (average length and average age of sprat) and also sprat catch from two geographically similar in climatic conditions regions, the Crimean region and the Western region (the shelf of Bulgaria and Romania), was investigated. Interregional differences in characteristics of the size-age population structure and fishing conditions were identified. In the Crimean region, the average length of sprat varied from 5.57 to 6.85 cm, the average was 6.43 cm. The interannual amplitude of the SL fluctuations was near 20 %. The average sprat age varied from 0.9 to 1.57 year, the average fish age in the population was 1.4 year. The interannual amplitude of sprat age fluctuations was more than 57 %. Negative trends of the average sprat length and its average age have been determined, indicating deterioration of the population state as a whole and of its commercial quality, in particular. The annual commercial catch of sprat varied from 11.4 to 24.78 thousand tons, the average annual catch was 16.09 thousand tons. The interannual amplitude of the catch fluctuations was more than 2.2 time. A close negative correlation between high catches and low average lengths and, as well as low average sprat age in the population for one year forward, was found (r = -0.81, p < 0.01 and r = -0.82, p < 0.01). In the Western region, unlike the Crimean, the sprat was longer, the average length of fish varied from 7.24 to 7.62 cm, average was 7.46 cm. Interannual amplitude of fluctuations less than 5 % indicated a sustainable state of the population. The annual commercial catch of sprat varied from 2.77 to 4.64 thousand tons, with the fishing effort upon the population did not exceed the maximum allowable level. The average annual catch was 3.75 thousand tons, which was 4.3 time lower than that in the Crimean region. There was no significant correlation between the catch and the average length of sprat (r = -0.27, p > 0.15). Local overfishing of sprat in the Crimean region together with long-term progressive deterioration of the sprat population state suggested division of total commercial fish stock into separate commercial unit stocks. This contradicts the concept of total commercial stock (a single population) of the Black Sea sprat. This conclusion is preliminary and further investigations in this area are to be made. © 2020 Marine Biological Journal.

However, impacts could vary at very small scale and the resolution of VMS data might not be fine enough. Other proxy could be used, such as trawl marks visible on the seabed observed by underwater video or side-scan sonar to evaluate small-scale trawling effort. In the Bay of Biscay, an underwater video survey of the Nephrops norvegicus fishing ground was conducted and provided environmental characteristics such as depth and number of trawl marks at 152 transects. The relevance of observed trawl marks as a small-scale proxy of trawling effort was tested depending on the sediment type. The model showed a significant positive relation between density of marks and trawling effort for all sediments together but a different relation for each sediment type. Considering each sediment type separately, the unexpected high number of marks observed on sands could be linked with cohesive interactions between calcium carbonates particles while the low number of marks on fine lithoclastic muds could be due to sediment reworking and bioturbation. We conclude that the impact of trawling on the seabed varies with the type of sediments, hydrodynamic parameters, bioturbation and trawling intensity, leading to a very complex relationship. Trawl marks observed on video footage thus could be used as a proxy of trawling effort among the same type of sediment and not for fine lithoclastic muds. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd;English;Article;All Open Access, Green;Scopus;NA;NE-Atlantic;>100,000;month;5,000-10,000;snapshot/no repeat sampling;Visual Analyses of Quadrats/Transects;NA;Non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis multi-comparison _ zero-inflated negative binomial model;3;2;3;We conclude that the impact of trawling on the seabed varies with the type of sediments, hydrodynamic parameters, bioturbation and trawling intensity, leading to a very complex relationship.;NA;4.3;Field experiment;Physical_habitats;Mixed;NA;NA;Trawl marks;Physical disturbance of the seabed;NA;Fishing hours;Sediment type;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;Otter trawl;Nephrops norvegicus;Trawl mark density;Abundance/biomass/density;Positive;The model showed a significant positive relation between density of marks and trawling effort for all sediment together.;vdReijden

We sampled soft-seafloor macrofauna over a precise trawling gradient in the Kattegat using hourly vessel monitoring systems and logbooks. The gradient included the establishment of a marine protected area (MPA), where trawling intensity declined sharply to zero. Our results show shifts in the macrofauna assemblage and non-linear responses, with decreases in the number and diversity of species at low to medium trawling intensities. The benthic community was dominated by burrowing brittle stars, of which one species, Amphiura chiajei, increased in abundance from low to medium trawling intensities. We interpret this positive response to increasing trawling intensities as a consequence of reduction in predation by benthivorous flatfish and Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus, which are significant catches of the fishery. The response was supported by a corresponding trend towards lower abundance of the dominating brittle stars following enforcement of the MPA and presumably an increase in benthivore density and predation pressure within the MPA. We conclude that chronic bottom trawling reduces diversity and may boost the abundances of species resistant to bottom trawling. The results emphasize the need to consider food web effects when assessing the impact of bottom trawling. © Inter-Research 2018.;English;Article;All Open Access, Green;Scopus;NA;North Sea - non CS;>100,000;five year;5,000-10,000;year;Other;Modified Smith-McIntyre grab;PERMANOVA _ distance-based linear modelling _ distance-based redundancy analysis;3;3;3;Our results show small but significant shifts in community composition and a decrease in number of species and indices of dversity as trawling intensity increased from low to medium levels, i.e. below 5 yr-1.;NA;4.3;Field experiment;Benthos;Benthic_infauna;NA;Mud;NA;Physical disturbance of the seabed;NA;Swept Area Ratio;Depth;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;Otter trawl;OTB_CRU _ OTB_DMF;Community composition;Community composition;Negative;Our results show small but significant shifts in community composition and a decrease in number of species and indices of diversity as trawling intensity increased from low to medium levels, i.e. below 5 yr-1.;vdReijden

The transgressive phase (10,000–6000 BP) is characterized by strongly time-averaged communities dominated by infaunal bivalves. During the early highstand (6000–4000 BP), the abundance of epifaunal filter feeders and grazers increases, and gastropods become more important. Epifaunal dominance culminates during the late highstand (4000–2000 BP) with the development of extensive shell beds formed by large-sized Arca noae and Ostrea sp. bivalves. This community persists until the early 20th century, when it falls victim to multiple anthropogenic impacts, mainly bottom trawling, and is substituted by an infauna-dominated community indicative of instability, disturbance and organic enrichment. The re-establishment of this unique shell-bed ecosystem can be a goal for restoration efforts. © 2017;English;Article;All Open Access, Hybrid Gold;Scopus;NA;CS - Mediterranean;0-5;subday;0-5;snapshot/no repeat sampling;Other;Benthic cores;Summarizing statistics;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4.3;Field experiment;Benthos;NA;NA;Sand;Mollusc community;Physical disturbance of the seabed;NA;Fishing activity;Eutrophication _ industrialization ;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;NA;NA;Community composition;Community composition;Multiple;The trend from an infauna- to an epifauna-dominated community reverses and the percentage of infauna increases, while species associated with marine vegetation decrease.

Three lost gears were recorded showing different levels of epibiosis thus supporting multi-annual exploitation of the bank. The red coral population of the Ragusa bank showed a typical ‘forest-like’ configuration with upright, medium-sized colonies similar to those of other commercially exploited deep Mediterranean banks. The direct negative effect of this trawling gear was evident from numerous rocky boulders completely enveloped by lost nets and occasionally turned over. Red coral fragments as well as fragments of ‘ingegno’ nets were observed in high abundance on the sea floor. This evidence suggests that this gear is highly destructive even on rough sea floors, contrary to the traditional view, which is that it has a more random impact on rough rocky bottoms. The estimated coral uptake of ‘ingegno’ is 45% of the total coral biomass, while the estimated coral loss, in terms of fragments, is 9%, demonstrating the high impact of this gear. The study highlighted the infringement of the red coral fishing ban by trawling gears as well as a lack of effective policing. The strengthening of controls on landings at nearby harbours, and education programmes for the local maritime communities are among the management actions proposed to protect these surviving red coral populations from the ongoing illegal fishing activity.

By integrating diverse sources of information and allowing for missing data, this approach may be particularly applicable in data-limited situations. Wild populations of anadromous sea trout (Salmo trutta) in the northern Baltic Sea have undergone severe declines, with the loss of many populations. The contribution of fisheries to this decline has not been quantified, but is thought to be significant. We apply the Bayesian mark-recapture model to two reared sea trout stocks from the Finnish Isojoki and Lestijoki Rivers.

Recreational gillnet fishing at sea was estimated to be the most important source of fishing mortality for both stocks, particularly during the 1980s and 1990s.

We present a method for estimating migration and fishing mortality rates for anadromous fishes that combines tag return data from commercial and recreational fisheries with expert opinion in a Bayesian framework. By integrating diverse sources of information and allowing for missing data, this approach may be particularly applicable in data-limited situations. Wild populations of anadromous sea trout (Salmo trutta) in the northern Baltic Sea have undergone severe declines, with the loss of many populations. The contribution of fisheries to this decline has not been quantified, but is thought to be significant. We apply the Bayesian mark-recapture model to two reared sea trout stocks from the Finnish Isojoki and Lestijoki Rivers. Over the study period (1987-2012), the total harvest rate was estimated to average 0.82 y-1 for the Isojoki River stock and 0.74 y-1 for the Lestijoki River stock.

So far, information on sea turtle bycatch in Italy is limited both in space and time due to logistical problems in data collected through onboard observations and on a limited number of vessels involved. In the present study, sea turtle bycatch in Italian waters was examined by collecting fishermen's information on turtle bycatch through an interview-based approach. Their replies enabled the identification of bycatch hotspots in relation to area, season and to the main gear types. The most harmful fishing gears resulted to be trawl nets, showing the highest probabilities of turtle bycatch with a hotspot in the Adriatic Sea, followed by longlines in the Ionian Sea and in the Sicily Channel. Estimates obtained by the present results showed that more than 52,000 capture events and 10,000 deaths occurred in Italian waters in 2014, highlighting a more alarming scenario than earlier studies.

Data on 633 strandings were obtained frommonitoring of a 35-km long area of the south coast of the Sea of Azov in 1999-2013.Adistinct peak of strandings fell in July and August: it depended on the bycatch peak and calving season. Stranding rates depended neither on weather conditions nor on the seasonal fishing activities (including IUU fisheries). Moreover, stranding peaks in the neighbouring Black Sea were also tied to the calving season rather than to the fishing activities. We suggest that the seasonal mortality patterns are indirectly determined by nutritional stress: in Atlantic, winter-stranding oceanic populations and summer-stranding inner-sea populations occur that also possibly differ in the seasonal dynamics of body mass, weaning time or duration of mother-calf association, and dentine structure. In a typical summer-stranding population, summer is the season of nutritional stress, parturition, independent foraging of yearlings and lactation of nursing females, which leads to the risky foraging behaviour near gillnets. Another possible factor of increased bycatch is the seasonal habitat preference, corresponding to the gillnet preferences. Therefore, stranding and bycatch seasonality of porpoises can largely be explained by the aspects of their life history and foraging behaviour rather than by weather conditions and fisheries. This supports the time-area closure strategy as an adequate conservation measure, which would consider minimizing the conflict of interest with fisheries. © International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2014.

These changes may negatively affect prey availability for demersal fishes, potentially leading to reduced food intake, body condition and yield of fishes in chronically trawled areas. Here, the effect of trawling on the prey availability and diet of two commercially important flatfish species, plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and dab (Limanda limanda), was investigated over a trawling intensity gradient in the Irish Sea. Previous work in this area has shown that trawling negatively affects the condition of plaice but not of dab. This study showed that reductions in local prey availability did not result in reduced feeding of fish. As trawling frequency increased, both fish and prey biomass declined, such that the ratio of fish to prey remained unchanged. Consequently, even at frequently trawled sites with low prey biomass, both plaice and dab maintained constant levels of stomach fullness and gut energy contents. However, dietary shifts in plaice towards energy-poor prey items were evident when prey species were analysed individually. This, together with a potential decrease in foraging efficiency due to low prey densities, was seen as the most plausible cause for the reduced body condition observed.

This study showed that reductions in local prey availability did not result in reduced feeding of fish. As trawling frequency increased, both fish and prey biomass declined, such that the ratio of fish to prey remained unchanged. Consequently, even at frequently trawled sites with low prey biomass, both plaice and dab maintained constant levels of stomach fullness and gut energy contents. However, dietary shifts in plaice towards energy-poor prey items were evident when prey species were analysed individually. This, together with a potential decrease in foraging efficiency due to low prey densities, was seen as the most plausible cause for the reduced body condition observed. Understanding the relationship between trawling, benthic impacts, fish foraging and resultant body condition is an important step in designing successful mitigation measures for future management strategies in bottom trawl fisheries. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Here, N90, a diversity index based on the species' contribution to the similarity between samples in a group, is presented. N90 uses the results of the classic Similarity Percentage analysis and a jack-knife routine to calculate the average and a dispersion value of the number of species contributing up to the ninety percent of the similarity in a group of samples. N90 is applied to two groups of samples subjected to contrasting levels of bottom trawl fishing pressure using time series of experimental bottom trawl surveys of the Balearic Islands. The results are compared to those obtained using more 'traditional' diversity indices such as species richness, Shannon-Wienner, Simpson, Pielou, and Margalef diversity indices. The N90 diversity index displayed a clear response to fishing pressure with significantly lower values in impacted communities, while the 'traditional' diversity indices showed almost null sensitivity to fishing pressure. In addition, N90 also detects indirect fishing impacts by fluctuating in response to environmental variation in impacted areas, making this index sensitive to the synergies between climate and fishing impact at community level. The application of the N90 diversity index to the case study shows that it may be an alternative to 'traditional' diversity indices when trying to monitor fishing impacts and the effects of environmental changes. Its units, number of species, and the corresponding summary list of species facilitate the interpretability of the results, improving the communication to managers and stakeholders. ©2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, few studies have tested the possible effects of gear and spatial aggregation of landings data on different ecological indices over a long-term period. To do this, we applied the Marine Trophic Index (MTI) and Fishing in Balance (FiB) index to Greek landings data disaggregated by gear and area for the period between 1928 and 2010. Aggregated data showed an increase in MTI due to expansion of fisheries that was also confirmed in most of the disaggregated analysis conducted by fishing subareas and main gear types. On the other hand, disaggregated landings by gear and area provided additional insights: while aggregated landings showed no decline in MTI, disaggregated landings showed that 63% of cases indicated an increase in MTI while 11% showed a decline. When small pelagics and other species were excluded, these values changed to 42% and 24%, respectively. Thus, disaggregated data permitted the identification of ecologically meaningful critical situations with decreasing MTI, as has been observed in shallow enclosed gulfs in close proximity to large cities and/or for the main fishing grounds exploited for long periods by seiners (purse and beach). Moreover, disaggregating landings data by gear increased the ability of explaining observed trends, avoiding masking (averaging) effects and accounting for differential development and adaptability of different gear. © 2014 Inter-Research.;English;Article;All Open Access, Green;Scopus;NA;Mediterranean - non CS;>100,000;multidecadal;50,000-100,000;year;Fisheries Dependent Data;NA;Linear regression;2;2;2;Aggregated Greek landings data showed an increase in landings, MTI and FiB;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Fourteen vessels fished a total of 168 days in the North Sea in 1997. In the wreck fishery the total effort was 1052 nets with active pingers, 1056 nets with dummy pingers and 74 nets without pingers. Eight porpoises were caught, all in nets with dummy pingers. In the flat bottom/stony ground fishery the total effort was 5596 nets with active pingers, 5210 nets with dummy pingers and 2973 nets without pingers. Sixteen porpoises were caught, including 1 animal in a net with active pingers, 6 in nets with dummy pingers and 9 in nets without pingers. The difference in bycatch between nets with active pingers and nets with inactive or no pingers was highly significant (p<. 0.007) for both the wreck fishery and the flat bottom/stony ground fishery. We conclude that the direct effects of the pinger signals on the porpoises caused the reduction in bycatch, which means that the results can be generalized to other situations where harbour porpoises are taken in gillnets. Generalized linear modelling demonstrated that cod cpue was not affected negatively by pingers. It was furthermore estimated that the stony ground fishery had significantly lower (p<. 0.001) cpue values (a factor 0.47) compared to the wreck fishery.

Understanding how trawl fisheries affect the wider ecosystem is an important component of the ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management. In this context the current study examined the impact of the otter trawl fishery on the infaunal communities found on the continental shelf and upper slope off the coast of Sicily and Calabria, Italy. A total of thirty six sites were sampled across a gradient of fishing intensity and from within a large bay from which trawling has been excluded for 22 years. Fishing intensities were ascertained post-hoc from vessel monitoring system data. Seabed characteristics of the sites studied were uniform across the continental shelf and slope areas that were studied, such that the only factor that varied was fishing intensity. The density index (DI) and total number of species (S) were significantly higher in the fishery closure area compared with other continental shelf sites. In particular, bioturbating decapod fauna occurred only within the fishery closure area. Fished sites were dominated primarily by burrowing deposit feeding worms, small bivalves and scavenging biota. In contrast, the response to fishing on the upper slope was less clear. This observation was treated with caution as the power to detect fishing effects was lower for the upper slope sites as a result of possible illegal fishing that had compromised two of the four replicate sites within the closed area. While the present study was able to quantify the effect of the demersal trawl fleet on the benthic infauna of the continental shelf, the effects of trawling on the upper shelf slope remain unclear and warrant further study. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.;English;Article;NA;Scopus;NA;Mediterranean - non CS;>100,000;month;5,000-10,000;snapshot/no repeat sampling;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;ANOSIM _ ANOVA;2;2;3;The presence of impoverished communities characterised by the reduction in the total number of species and density in the most highly exploited areas, confirmed that the infaunal communities were negatively affected by fishing disturbance.;NA;4.3 _ 4.4;Field experiment;Benthos;Benthic_infauna;NA;Mud;NA;Physical disturbance of the seabed;NA;Swept Area Ratio;depth _ mean particle size _  percentages of sand, silt and clay;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;Otter trawl;NA;Community composition;Community composition;Negative;One-way ANOSIM revealed that fishing had a significant effect on the species abundance data in the continental shelf but not in the upper slope.;vdReijden

Fishery management measures in this area include a trawling period of 8 months per year (October to May). Macrofauna samples were collected before and after 30 and 120 days of the commencement of the trawling period (temporal axis) along a southward transect (spatial axis) and down through the sediment profile (vertical axis).Results: Main results revealed no recognizable changes in community diversity and structure at temporal scales. This finding can probably be attributed to the fact that the examined communities are subjected to continuous disturbances deriving from multiple natural and anthropogenic stressors acting simultaneously in Thermaikos Gulf. Molluscan assemblages were already stressed before the commencement of the trawling period, indicating that the time period in which bottom trawling is prohibited is not sufficient for the recovery of benthic communities. Significant shifts in the trophic structure of molluscan assemblages were also detected. The direct mortality of herbivorous species and the loss of filter feeding organisms may be attributed to the passage of the fishing gear and to sediment re-suspension, respectively. Trawling disturbance may have created the observed vertical patterns of the community structure since hauling induces profound changes in the geochemical profile of the sediment. Conclusions: Our findings sustained the notion that bottom trawling, alongside with other types of human induced stressors, can have considerable effects on the structure and function of the benthic domain. Therefore, our results highlighted the need of an Ecosystem Based Fishery Management (EBFM) perspective in Thermaikos Gulf to ensure both fisheries and ecosystem sustainability. © 2014 Dimitriadis et al.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this area, this resource is mainly exploited with rapido trawl and set nets. The stock is not yet depleted and faces a situation of growth overfishing. The comparison between the spatial distribution by age of S. solea and the geographic patterns of the rapido trawl fishing effort evidenced an overlapping of this fishing activity with the area where juveniles concentrate (age groups 0-2). The majority of spawners inhabits specific offshore areas, here defined as 'sole sanctuaries', where high concentrations of debris and benthic communities make difficult trawling with rapido.The aim of this study was to evaluate existing spatial management regimes and potential new spatial and temporal closures in the northern and central Adriatic Sea using a simple modelling tool. Two spatial simulations were carried out in order to verify the effectiveness of complementary methods for the management of fisheries: the ban of rapido trawling from October to December within 6. nautical miles and 9. nautical miles of the Italian coast. The focus of the simulation is that the effort of the rapido trawl is moved far from the coast during key sole recruitment periods, when the juveniles are moving from the inshore nursery area toward the offshore feeding grounds. The management scenarios showed that a change in selectivity would lead to a clear increase in the spawning stock biomass and an increase in landings of S. solea in the medium-term. The rapido trawl activity could be managed by using a different logic, bearing in mind that catches and incomes would increase with small changes in the spatial pattern of the fishing effort.The present study highlights the importance of taking into account spatial dimensions of fishing fleets and the possible interactions that can occur between fleets and target species, facilitating the development of control measures to achieve a healthy balance between stock exploitation and socio-economic factors. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.;English;Article;NA;Scopus;NA;CS - Mediterranean;50,000-100,000;five year;>100,000;year;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;NOAA Fisheries Toolbox AGEPRO 3.4.1.;3;3;3;Taking into account the relationship between spatial distribution of rapido trawl fishing effort and common sole by age it is possible to ascertain that rapido trawl activity focuses in areas of high concentration of juvenile soles of ages from 0 to 2, determining consequently negative trend in the spawing stock biomass;NA;None;Modelling/simulation;Fish_teleost;Flatfish;NA;NA;Solea solea;Catch_and_bycatch;Target;Fishing mortality;Distance to shore _ depth;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;Otter trawl;Rapido trawling;CpUE _ SSB;Abundance/biomass/density;Negative;The population-selective curves derived from different rates of asymmetric dispersion predicted a reduction in both SSB and landings over a 10-year period.

Monthly samples of silver roughy were sampled from the catches of four commercial trawlers in 2004. Each trawler operated in different fishing grounds (FGs), located off Northern Tunisia, South of Sicily, Malta Islands and in South Levant, for which different exploitation levels are reported. The overall length-frequency distribution (LFD) was constructed, and fishing impact indices (length as percentage of LFD, optimum and maximum length, percentage of mega-spawners and total mortality/von Bertalanffy curvature ratio) were calculated. In spite of an overall acceptable status (juveniles, matures and mega-spawners were present in the catch), sampling data revealed significant differences in LFD shape and status indices between FGs. Those FGs traditionally considered more exploited (Northern Tunisia and South of Sicily) showed a dominance of juveniles, a rarefaction of mega-spawners, a reduction in maximum and asymptotic length and a higher Z/K ratio. Considering the general homogeneity of Mediterranean deep-water habitats, the pelagic dispersal of eggs and the poor swimming capabilities of silver roughy, the present results indicated that deep-water trawling may induce a slow and subtle, although significant, erosion of the older, late maturing and slow growing component of the stocks in the Mediterranean (so-called longevity-overfishing). © Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom 2014.;English;Article;NA;Scopus;NA;Mediterranean - non CS;>100,000;year;50,000-100,000;month;Fisheries Dependent Data;NA;Summarizing statistics;3;3;3;Looking at the overall LFD, almost all indices used suggest an acceptable status of H. mediterraneus population in the central–eastern Mediterranean, whereas the analysis of the LFDs by FG showed potential signs of over-exploitation of the parental component in 1NT and 2SS.;NA;4.2;Fisheries dependent survey;Fish_teleost;Roundfish;NA;NA;Hoplostethus mediterraneus;Discarding;NA;Fishing activity;NA;Commercial;Demersal_trawls;Otter trawl;deep-water crustacean trawl fishery (CTF);length–frequency distribution;Size/age structure;Multiple;Looking at the overall LFD, almost all indices used suggest an acceptable status of H. mediterraneus population in the central–eastern Mediterranean, whereas the analysis of the LFDs by FG showed potential signs of over-exploitation of the parental component in 1NT and 2SS.;vdReijden

While a number of studies have assessed the impacts of trawling on faunal community structure and the degree to which different taxa are vulnerable to trawling, few have focused on how these impacts affect important ecological functions of the seabed. In this study, we use biological trait analysis (BTA) to assess the relative sensitivity of benthic macrofauna to trawling, in both the short- and long-term, and use this information to describe the spatial variation in sensitivity of secondary production for the Greater North Sea (GNS).Within the GNS, estimates of total production varied by almost three orders of magnitude, from 1.66kJm-2y-1 to 968.9kJm-2y-1. Large-scale patterns were observed in the proportion of secondary production derived from trawling-sensitive taxa. In the southern North Sea, total production is predominantly governed by taxa with low sensitivity to trawling, whereas production is relatively trawling-sensitive in the northern North Sea and western English Channel. In general, the more sensitive and productive regions are associated with poorly-sorted, gravelly or muddy sediments, while the less sensitive and less productive regions are associated with well-sorted, sandy substrates. These relationships between production sensitivity and environmental features are primarily due to variations in long-term recovery;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This allowed us to determine the structure and functioning of this ecosystem and assess the impacts of fishing upon it. The model represents the average state of the ecosystem between 2000 and 2005. It includes 41 functional groups, which encompass the entire trophic spectrum from phytoplankton to higher trophic levels (e.g., fishes, birds, and mammals), and also considers the fishing activities in the area (five fleets). Model results highlight an important bentho-pelagic coupling in the system due to the links between plankton and benthic invertebrates through detritus. A comparison of this model with those developed for other continental shelf regions in the Mediterranean (i.e., the southern Catalan, the northern-central Adriatic, and the northern Aegean Seas) emphasizes similar patterns in their trophic functioning. Low and medium trophic levels (i.e., zooplankton, benthic molluscs, and polychaetes) and sharks were identified as playing key ecosystem roles and were classified as keystone groups. An analysis of ecosystem attributes indicated that the Gulf of Gabes is the least mature (i.e., in the earliest stages of ecosystem development) of the four ecosystems that were compared and it is suggested that this is due, at least in part, to the impacts of fishing. Bottom trawling was identified as having the widest-ranging impacts across the different functional groups and the largest impacts on some commercially-targeted demersal fish species.

This allowed us to determine the structure and functioning of this ecosystem and assess the impacts of fishing upon it. The model represents the average state of the ecosystem between 2000 and 2005. It includes 41 functional groups, which encompass the entire trophic spectrum from phytoplankton to higher trophic levels (e.g., fishes, birds, and mammals), and also considers the fishing activities in the area (five fleets). Model results highlight an important bentho-pelagic coupling in the system due to the links between plankton and benthic invertebrates through detritus. A comparison of this model with those developed for other continental shelf regions in the Mediterranean (i.e., the southern Catalan, the northern-central Adriatic, and the northern Aegean Seas) emphasizes similar patterns in their trophic functioning. Low and medium trophic levels (i.e., zooplankton, benthic molluscs, and polychaetes) and sharks were identified as playing key ecosystem roles and were classified as keystone groups. An analysis of ecosystem attributes indicated that the Gulf of Gabes is the least mature (i.e., in the earliest stages of ecosystem development) of the four ecosystems that were compared and it is suggested that this is due, at least in part, to the impacts of fishing. Bottom trawling was identified as having the widest-ranging impacts across the different functional groups and the largest impacts on some commercially-targeted demersal fish species.

These data are unique in the Baltic Sea region. To date, they only have been known from summary reports that have been cited repeatedly in papers regarding the habi-tat preference and sizes of historical populations of harbour porpoises in the Baltic Sea. Lacking other sources of information, archival data had a great importance in the delimitation of Special Areas of Conservation (NATURA 2000) desig-nated for harbour porpoise in Poland. Analysis of archival source materials suggested discrepan-cies between fisheries inspectors' reports and the published data. These new data provided detailed information on harbour porpoise bycatch, includ-ing the time of capture, gear type utilized, and the location of fishing grounds where harbour por-poises were most frequently caught. In summa-tion, fisheries inspectors registered 691 individual harbour porpoises. The animals were registered primarily in the spring, from March to April, during targeted salmonid catches throughout the Gdansk Bay region and the open sea off the Hel Peninsula coast. The majority of caught ani-mals were recorded from the Hel fishing district. Contrary to conclusions to date, these instances cannot be attributed to the bounties offered for the ""elimination of pests."" This paper also addresses and discusses the dependence on the number of registered harbour porpoise catches over a series of years and the maximum ice cover on the Baltic Sea as the factors influencing harbour porpoises' periodic declines (Teilmann & Lowry, 1996).";English;Article;NA;Scopus;NA;Baltic Sea - non CS;10,000-50,000;decade;1,000-5,000;month;Irregular Fisheries Independent Survey;NA;Summarizing statistics;2;2;2;Fisheries inspectors registered 691 individual harbour porpoises.

Dynamic simulations were based on a spatial ecological model previously calibrated with time series of data. Scenarios regarding spatial management were evaluated with the establishment of two marine protected areas, respectively, in the Pomo pit and the northern region. In addition, three temporal simulations of temporary closures and overall reduction of fishing effort of demersal and pelagic fleets (bottom, mid-water trawls and purse seines) were also considered. Simulations were run for 45. years (1975-2020), including the calibration period (1975-2002), and changes in biomass and catch of marine resources were analyzed. Our results confirm that current fishing management in the Adriatic Sea does not have clear beneficial impacts for the recovery of exploited resources, which will remain depleted in 2020 if ""business as usual"" continues. Simulations of alternative management suggest that both protected areas could be beneficial for fish population recovery predicting an increase in the biomass of commercial fish and predatory organisms. Simulations of temporary closures and overall reduction of fishing effort also show significant benefits for several commercial resources. We argue that both management measures may be effective tools to recover exploited ecosystems of the Northern-Central Adriatic Sea and halt the decline of marine resources. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.";English;Article;All Open Access, Green;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;None;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;vdReijden

An interdisciplinary methodology (specifically designed for selecting cold-water coral protection areas) and a case study focused on the Hatton Bank (NE Atlantic) are presented. This interdisciplinary approach, developed under the ECOVUL/ARPA project, was based on conventional fisheries science, geomorphology, benthic ecology, and sedimentology. It contributes to defining practical criteria for identifying VMEs, to improving knowledge of their distribution off Europe's continental shelf, and to providing advice on negative fishing impacts and habitat protection. The approach was used to identify the bottom-trawl deep-sea fishery footprint on the western slope of Hatton Bank, to map the main fishing grounds and related deep-sea habitats (1000-1500 m deep), and to study the interactions between fisheries and cold-water corals. The results lead to a proposal to close the outcrop area (4645 km2) located on the western slope of Hatton Bank as a conservation measure for cold-water corals. © 2009 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

The investigation was carried out in the Cape Creus Marine Protected Area (MPA). Overall, 20 fish species and 1 invertebrate species were identified (three were coastal pelagic and the rest rocky benthic or demersal). In terms of abundance, two omnivorous species made up the 44% of the catch but in terms of weight, the main part (77%) of the catches relied on seven piscivorous (i.e. top-predator) fish (with trophic level values greater than 3.80). With the exception of three fish, the specie's intrinsic vulnerability values ranged between 40 and 90 (out of 100), implying a moderate to very high vulnerability to fishing. Spearfishing mainly targets large individuals measuring more than 30 cm in length. It is estimated that the total annual biomass extracted by spearfishing in the MPA is equivalent to ca. 40% of the total biomass extracted annually by artisanal (commercial) fishing. Overall, results highlight the pressure spearfishing exerts on the reproductive potential of fish species in rocky habitats along the Mediterranean coast, particularly those that are vulnerable (i.e. long lived and slow growing species with low reproductive potential) and have a higher trophic level. Results support the assumption that spearfishing can induce changes in both the trophic structure and the intrinsic vulnerability of taxa in the catch. Considering the biological implications of spearfishing, management should be supported by additional regulations in order to protect species that are vulnerable and have a higher trophic level. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Estimated sedimentation rates based on 210Pb and 137Cs profiles suggest that the contemporary trends of sediment transfer and accumulation in the canyon may be different from secular trends. During the seventies, a two-fold increase of the sediment accumulation rate took place at the 1750 m depth site. This change has been associated to trawling activities and is attributed to the rapid technical development that the local trawling fleet underwent during the seventies. The surroundings and rims of submarine canyons are frequently targeted by commercial trawling fisheries, an activity that may enhance the input of resuspended particles into canyons, and eventually trigger sediment gravity flows. Our results suggest that the effects of trawling over the dynamics of the seafloor may extend further and deeper from the fishing grounds, eventually extending to bathyal depths. Hence the anthropogenic influence on the sedimentary budget of some deep submarine environments may be more important than previously thought. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We analysed and compared the structuration of diversity within three different bathymetric strata: the continental shelf (60-120 m depth), the upper slope (250-400 m) and the lower slope (450-570 m). For each of these three bathymetric strata, we simultaneously analysed 12 indices that are theoretically complementary and relate to 4 diversity components: (1) the number of species, (2) rarity, (3) evenness and (4) taxonomic diversity. Principal component analysis based on Spearman's correlation coefficients was carried out to investigate empirical relationships between the selected indices. Our results showed not only that a single diversity index cannot provide a complete view of the groundfish diversity along the east coast of Corsica, but also that - in some cases - one index cannot even encapsulate a complete description of a specific diversity component. We also found that the nature and the number of independent diversity components slightly varied from one bathymetric stratum to another. The main differences - which mainly occurred in the deepest bathymetric stratum - might be associated with lower density of individuals and lower dominance of some species at deeper depths. Finally, this study is the first dealing with groundfish diversity in this area, which is currently characterized by one of the lowest fishing intensity rates in the northern Mediterranean Sea. It might be considered as a first ""reference state"" with a view to monitoring the spatio-temporal changes in species diversity patterns along the east coast of Corsica in the future. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

High-resolution fishing effort data from the Kattegat, an important fishing ground for Swedish and Danish fishermen, was analysed in a Geographical Information System (GIS). Data were based on position data for individual tows reported by Swedish fishermen during 2001-2003. 2. Gear dimension and towing speed data were used to calculate an index for area swept per hour for each main gear type in use in the area. These indexes were multiplied by fishing effort and a grid theme of fishing intensity was created after GIS analysis. 3. Around 44% of the entire area was affected by Swedish fisheries during the study period, hence 56% was not affected. 4. Effort was highly concentrated in certain areas and 10% of the total area was covered more than twice per year. 5. Overlaying the effort data set with habitat maps classified according to the European Nature Information System (EUNIS) showed that the fishing pressure differed between habitats. For deep rocky and muddy habitats, almost the entire area was affected by fisheries during the study period, while both intensity and proportion affected were lower in sandy sediments and gravels. 6. Around 55% of the deep rocky habitats were trawled more than twice per year. Of the muddy seafloor areas, 41% were covered more than twice per year and 4% more than once a month by trawls. 7. The biological effects of the fishing intensities found were analysed using a database (MarLIN) containing assessments of marine habitat recoverability. All habitats except muds are probably in a nearly or fully recovered condition (as defined by MarLIN). A considerable part of the muddy habitats are in a permanently altered condition owing to fishing disturbance taking place more frequently than the indicated recovery time. 8. Danish fishermen report more fishing effort in the area than do Swedes. Owing to differences in reporting fishing positions, Danish fisheries could not be included in the present study. Scaling up the results to include Danish fisheries is discussed. 9. The results of the present study could be used to target habitat management goals more precisely, while minimizing the negative impact of restrictions on the fishing sector. 10. A prerequisite for performing similar studies is the availability of high-resolution fishing effort data and high-resolution benthic habitat maps.

Data were based on position data for individual tows reported by Swedish fishermen during 2001-2003. 2. Gear dimension and towing speed data were used to calculate an index for area swept per hour for each main gear type in use in the area. These indexes were multiplied by fishing effort and a grid theme of fishing intensity was created after GIS analysis. 3. Around 44% of the entire area was affected by Swedish fisheries during the study period, hence 56% was not affected. 4. Effort was highly concentrated in certain areas and 10% of the total area was covered more than twice per year. 5. Overlaying the effort data set with habitat maps classified according to the European Nature Information System (EUNIS) showed that the fishing pressure differed between habitats. For deep rocky and muddy habitats, almost the entire area was affected by fisheries during the study period, while both intensity and proportion affected were lower in sandy sediments and gravels. 6. Around 55% of the deep rocky habitats were trawled more than twice per year. Of the muddy seafloor areas, 41% were covered more than twice per year and 4% more than once a month by trawls. 7. The biological effects of the fishing intensities found were analysed using a database (MarLIN) containing assessments of marine habitat recoverability. All habitats except muds are probably in a nearly or fully recovered condition (as defined by MarLIN). A considerable part of the muddy habitats are in a permanently altered condition owing to fishing disturbance taking place more frequently than the indicated recovery time. 8. Danish fishermen report more fishing effort in the area than do Swedes. Owing to differences in reporting fishing positions, Danish fisheries could not be included in the present study. Scaling up the results to include Danish fisheries is discussed. 9. The results of the present study could be used to target habitat management goals more precisely, while minimizing the negative impact of restrictions on the fishing sector. 10. A prerequisite for performing similar studies is the availability of high-resolution fishing effort data and high-resolution benthic habitat maps.

The purpose of the monitoring is to reveal population status and elucidate long-term trends of fish population and community development. Time series cover 9-20 years of annual monitoring, the last year being 2002. Significant increasing trends of perch and roach catches were observed in the archipelago region of the Sea of Åland and Archipelago Sea. A possible reason for these trends was ongoing coastal eutrophication. Significant trends with opposite directions appeared in two areas in the Gulf of Bothnia and two areas at the Swedish coast of the Baltic Proper. The Curonian Lagoon is severely affected by anthropogenic impact, structuring the local fish community. Indications of decreased eutrophication were noted in the Gulf of Riga. High fishing pressure during the 1990s in the West-Estonian archipelago and the following collapse of coastal fish stocks was apparent in the monitoring catches.;English;Article;NA;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4.4;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;vdReijden

We address the issue of how an iteroparous fish should convert surplus energy into somatic growth and reproduction at each age under given conditions of mortality. A model of life history, which maximizes the net reproductive rate using the discrete maximum principle, is improved employing a new relationship between body weight and surplus energy which we have recently proposed. The model is applied to the North Sea plaice Pleuronectes platessa, for which it has been reported that the average length of young fish had increased whereas that of old ones had decreased for some decades. Although the model cannot directly explain the former phenomenon, the two phenomena can be interpreted as a change in the optimal life history due mainly to an increase in mortality. © 1993 Society of Population Ecology.;English;Article;NA;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;None;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;vdReijden
SW4_1877;E4;Eriksson T., Eriksson L.-O.;The status of wild and hatchery propagated Swedish salmon stocks after 40 years of hatchery releases in the Baltic rivers;1993;Fisheries Research;18;44593;147;159;10.1016/0165-7836(93)90045-9;NA;The Baltic stocks of Atlantic salmon have been subjected to human exploitation for many centuries. During the last century, however, these salmon populations have been subjected to especially dramatic changes in spawning stream access, fishing patterns, and fishing pressure. At the end of the nineteenth century, salmon spawned in 60-70 rivers in the Baltic proper. From 1940 onwards many of the large salmon rivers were dammed, most of them below the lowest spawning rapids for salmon. Methods for rearing salmon up to the smolt stage were developed, and the first smolt releases started around 1950. The number of smolts released in Swedish rivers gradually increased to about 2-2.5 million by the middle of the 1980s. During the last 10 years other countries have started salmon release programs, resulting in an annual release of about 3 million smolts. Smolt releases have been successful, showing high survival rates of stocked fish. Today, only about 20 suitable rivers, most of them in Sweden, are available for natural spawning runs. The runs are very weak. Before the Second World War the Baltic salmon fishery mainly consisted of coastal and river catches of spawning migrators ascending the rivers. However, since the end of the war an offshore drift gillnet fishery has been developed, and nowadays makes up the major part of the total catch. As a consequence, the spawning runs of wild salmon have decreased dramatically. One hundred years ago the natural production of salmon from the Baltic salmon rivers was around 7-8 million smolts annually. In the early 1970s, the wild smolt run to the Baltic included about 2 million fish. At present, only about 0.5 million wild smolts are recruited to the whole Baltic proper, which is only about 20% of the smolt production capacity still remaining in the rivers. The offshore fishery on mixed populations in the central areas of the Baltic proper leads to an extremely high fishing pressure on the Baltic salmon stocks. Wild stocks are unable to cope with the present exploitation rate. As a result, the number of wild spawners in natural streams has gradually been diminishing. In the absence of a compensatory program, a reduction in stock-size of the magnitude shown by wild salmon in the Baltic would decrease catch-per-unit-effort to such a degree that there would be no economic incentive for a commercial salmon fishery. At present, however, about 90% of the salmon smolts leaving Baltic rivers are of hatchery origin. Owing to their extremely high egg-to-smolt survival rates the reared stocks can withstand this high exploitation. Thus the success of hatchery enhancement programs in combination with a lack of effective regulations, allowing a high-catch-per unit effort in the offshore fishery, is largely responsible for the sad fate of remaining wild salmon stocks in the Baltic. Any biologically sound management program for the Baltic salmon would have to include regulations prohibiting or severely restricting the offshore fishery on mixed stocks. Salmon stocks should be exploited in relation to the capacity of individual populations, by a more terminal fishery at the coast or in rivers. However, an established offshore fishery in the main Baltic, including (at least) seven nations, has so far made any kind of regulation difficult. © 1993.;English;Article;NA;Scopus;EXCLUDE on document type;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;4.2;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;vdReijden

Exceptionally large catches of soles are made in the North Sea during very cold winters. It was considered that these catches were due to increased vulnerability of the fish to trawling at low sea temperatures, and to the concentration of fish into smaller areas, of high density, by the cold water masses. A third contributory factor was that the soles remained on the offshore trawling grounds for a longer time in cold winters. 2. Data from fishing reports, sole catches in different regions of the southern North Sea, and the positions of recapture of tagged soles in the winter of 1962/63 were used to illustrate the changes in the behaviour of this fish. 3. Although soles suffered high mortalities from low temperatures, predation, and from fishing during winter 1962/63, reducing the numbers of potential spawning fish, it was suggested that the failure of the coastal spawning fisheries was also partly due to a large part of the stock failing to migrate inshore in this year. 4. It was considered that since soles appear to be particularly sensitive to low temperatures there might be a direct relationship between the winter catches of soles and the sea temperatures. This relationship was investigated and seems to hold good, at least for the post-war years since 1948. © 1964 Biologischen Anstalt Helgoland.;English;Article;All Open Access, Bronze;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;None;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;vdReijden

Models are important in predicting the consequences of management decisions and the design of monitoring programs in terms of policy goals. However, few tools are available that consider both multiple fleets and ecosystem scale dynamics. We use a new applied game theory tool, Ecoseed, that operates within a temporally and spatially explicit biomass dynamics model, Ecopath with Ecosim, to evaluate the efficacy of marine protected areas in the North Sea in both ecological and economic terms. The Ecoseed model builds MPAs based on the change in values of predicted economic rents of fisheries and the existence value of biomass pools in the ecosystem. We consider the market values of four fisheries operating in the North Sea: A trawl fishery, a gill net fishery, a seine fishery, and an industrial (reduction) fishery. We apply existence values, scaled such that their aggregate is similar to the total fishery value, to six biomass pools of concern: Juvenile cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, seals, and the collective pool ‘Other predators’ that include marine mammals. Four policy options were considered: to maximize the rent only;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Although North Sea fish stocks are monitored regularly, benthic fauna are not. Here, we report the results of a survey carried out in 2000, in which five nations sampled the epibenthic and fish fauna at 270 stations throughout the North Sea. The aim of the survey was to investigate the diversity and community structure of epibenthic and fish communities and to identify relationships with environmental factors, including the frequency of commercial otter and beam trawling disturbance. Epibenthic species diversity was lower in the southern North Sea than in central and northern areas. Fish, conversely, were more diverse in the south. The 50 m, 100 m and 200 m depth contours broadly defined the boundaries of benthic and fish communities. The abundance of epibenthos of the southern North Sea was dominated by free-living species, whilst north of the 50 m contour sessile species prevailed. A hybrid area, with sessile species typical of the north and free-living species characteristic of the south, was found off the Norfolk and Flamborough coast stretching towards the Dogger Bank. Large-scale hydrodynamic phenomena were most likely to be responsible for the main divisions between communities, especially the boundary between mixed and stratified water masses. However, bottom temperature, sediment parameters and beam trawling were closely correlated with species richness and diversity, as well as community patterns, and may modify regional species composition. Our study shows that effective large-scale sampling of benthic communities can be conducted during existing fisheries surveys. Since annual fisheries surveys are conducted throughout the northeast Atlantic shelf seas, concurrent benthic surveys would allow benthic sampling on unprecedented spatial and temporal scales. The samples would help to monitor the environmental impacts of trawling disturbance, climate change, pollution and other natural and anthropogenic factors. © 2002 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

The aim of the experiment was to evaluate (i) the effectiveness of pingers to reduce by-catch rate of harbour porpoises, and (ii) the effects of pingers on the catches of the target species in the fishery. The design of the study was based on a statistical power analysis and the results from observer programmes conducted 1995-1996 in the same area, fishery and time of year. The catches of cod, pollack and other fish species were not affected by the sound of the pingers in the active strings. No harbour porpoise was caught in any control or active string, which was a significantly lower by-catch rate than in the two previous years. This could not be explained by a reduction in fishing effort per se, a difference in the total catch of fish for consumption or a shift in the spatial distribution of the sets between the observer programmes and the pinger experiment. However, the spatial analyses demonstrated that the experimental strings were set parallel to the coast and along the 50 m isobath, and that the audible range of the active pingers on average covered 16% of the longitudinal length and 5% of the surface area of the experimental fishing area. A compilation of herring landings by Swedish fishermen operating in the Skagerrak Sea 1995-1997 suggests that herring were more abundant in 1997 than in 1995. Good access to food in other parts of the porpoises' distribution range and an aversive reaction to the ensonification could have caused their displacement in the fishing area. A displacement effect by pingers is likely to be more prominent in coastal waters where access to bodies of water is limited and the consequence may be serious if the area is critical to the survival of the porpoise population. © 2002 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

The experimental surveys were accomplished annually from 1994 to 2000 on approximately 1000 pre-defined sampling stations distributed in 15 major areas. Selection of stations was based on a depth-stratified random sampling scheme that included five depth strata: 10-50, 50-100, 100-200, 200-500 and 500-800 m. The examined species were found throughout the studied region, mostly in depths down to 200 m. Abundance differences among major areas were found to be statistically significant and were attributed to the different exploitation patterns, as well as the different abiotic and biotic conditions prevailing in each area. Although both species undergo high fishing pressure, results did not demonstrate any decreasing trends in their abundance indices suggesting the existence of a good stock-recruitment relationship over the studied period. However, the dominance of young fish that has been found, makes the stocks highly vulnerable to recruitment changes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Data are presented as total hours fishing by English, German, Norwegian, Scottish and Welsh vessels for the period 1977-1995, and by Danish, Dutch, English, German, Norwegian, Scottish and Welsh vessels for the period 1990-1995. Analyses of temporal trends indicated that total international trawling effort in the entire North Sea has increased slowly since 1977 and that it is currently (1995) 2.25 million h yr-1 of which 55% is due to beam trawling. Spatial analyses indicate that the proportion of beam trawling effort increases from north to south. Plots of annual fishing effort by ICES statistical rectangle (211 boxes of 0.5°latitude x 1°longitude) indicate that the majority of fishing effort in the North Sea are concentrated in a very few rectangles. Thus mean annual total fishing effort (1990-1995) was less than 2000 h in 29% of rectangles and less than 10 000 h in 66% of rectangles. Total effort exceeded 40 000 h in 4% of rectangles.

The majority of studies have examined the short-term effects of disturbance on benthic fauna. Some areas, however, such as the southern North Sea, have been subjected to fishing disturbance for over 50 years, which complicates predictions of long-term ecological change inferred from recent experimental studies. I highlight the importance of evaluating the ecological relevance of fishing disturbance versus natural perturbations, which varies among different habitats. Most experimental studies have shown that it is possible to detect short-term changes in community structure in response to fishing disturbance. Evidence suggests that long-term changes are probably restricted to long-lived fragile species or communities found in environments that are infrequently disturbed by natural phenomena. Understanding the relative ecological importance of physical disturbance by fishing versus natural events would provide a basis for predicting the outcome of fishing activities in different marine habitats. I suggest approaches that may refine attempts to correlate fishing intensity and frequency with community change, such as the use of tracking devices fitted to trawlers and surveys of fauna, such as bivalves and echinoderms, that record disturbance events of the past in their shells or body structure.;English;Article;NA;Scopus;EXCLUDE on evidence;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;None;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;NA;vdReijden

Intensive fishing occurred along the borders of the closed areas (12 mile zone and the 'plaice-box', a protected area in the eastern part of the North Sea) and at certain off-shore grounds in the southern and central North Sea. Effort distribution was studied within 30 x 30 (ICES rectangles), 10 x 10, 3 x 3 and 1 x 1 nautical mile squares and showed a patchy distribution. The degree of patchiness decreased with resolution. Within 3 x 3 mile squares, beam trawling was randomly distributed in some parts of the most heavily fished ICES rectangles but patchily distributed in others. Within 1 x 1 mile squares, the distribution became random within more than 90% of the squares. The micro-distribution showed a remarkable similarity between the 4 years with a mean coefficient of overlap of 0.66, range 0.56-0.76. The microdistribution of the sampled vessels was raised to the total Dutch fleet in order to estimate the frequency at which the sea bed was trawled. It was estimated that during the four year study period in eight of the most heavily fished rectangles of the North Sea, 5% of the surface area was trawled less than once in 5 years and 29% less than once in a year. The surface area of the sea bed that was trawled between 1 and 2 times in a year was estimated at 30%. The surface area trawled more than five times in a year was estimated at 9%.

A negative relationship was found between porpoise by-catch and tidal speed but no other relationships were found with operational or environmental variables.
